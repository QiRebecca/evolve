The primary overhead stems from repeatedly instantiating AESGCM for identical keys.  
I'll introduce a small cache so we reuse AESGCM objects, eliminate superfluous
validation/logging, and keep the implementation minimal.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM

# Constant for GCM tag length (bytes)
_GCM_TAG_BYTES = 16


class Solver:
    """
    Fast AES-GCM encryptor.

    The first call with a new key constructs an AESGCM object and stores it in a
    tiny in-memory cache so subsequent calls with the same key avoid re-creation
    overhead.  All other work is delegated to cryptographyâ€™s highly-optimised
    backend, so the Python layer is kept as lean as possible.

    __slots__ = ("_cache",)

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # key->AESGCM object cache (very small, typical benchmarks reuse keys)
        self._cache: Dict[bytes, AESGCM] = {}

        """Return a cached AESGCM instance for the given key (create if needed)."""
