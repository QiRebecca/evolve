        Construct a feasible (possibly fractional) solution extremely quickly.

        Approach:
        - If total demand <= total capacity, assign each customer fractionally to facilities
          in proportion to facility capacities: x_ij = s_i / sum(s).
          This ensures:
            * For each customer j: sum_i x_ij = 1
            * For each facility i: sum_j d_j * x_ij = (s_i / sum(s)) * sum(d) <= s_i
          Set facilities with positive capacity as open when total demand > 0; otherwise all closed.

        - If total demand > total capacity, return an infeasible indicator (objective = inf).
