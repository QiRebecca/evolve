analysisWe need to produce solver.py that solves the rocket landing optimization faster than baseline. Baseline uses CVXPY with generic solver. We can use cvxpy but maybe use a faster solver like ECOS or OSQP? But we can also use direct analytical solution? The problem is convex but not trivial. We can use cvxpy with OSQP or ECOS. But we can also use cvxpy with the default solver which might be ECOS. But we can speed up by using cvxpy with the 'ECOS_BB' or 'OSQP' or 'SCS' with appropriate settings. But the baseline uses default solver, which may be ECOS. We can try to use cvxpy with 'ECOS' but set verbose False, maybe use 'SCS' with 'max_iters' small? But we need optimal solution.

Alternatively, we can solve using linear programming? The objective is sum of norms of F, which is convex but not linear. But we can linearize by introducing auxiliary variables for each norm. That's what cvxpy does. We can use cvxpy with 'ECOS' or 'OSQP' but OSQP handles quadratic objective but not norms. But we can transform to linear objective with auxiliary variables and linear constraints: minimize gamma * sum(t_i) subject to ||F_t|| <= t_i. That's linear objective and second-order cone constraints. So we need SOCP solver. ECOS can handle that. So baseline uses ECOS. We can use cvxpy with ECOS but maybe set solver='ECOS' and options to speed up. But baseline uses default, which might be ECOS. So not much improvement.

We can try to use cvxpy with 'SCS' which is faster for large problems. But K is small (35). So not huge.

We can also use cvxpy with 'OSQP' by converting to quadratic objective? But objective is sum of norms, not quadratic. But we can approximate? Not allowed.

Alternatively, we can use a custom solver: we can solve the problem analytically using dynamic programming? But it's convex with linear dynamics and convex objective. We can solve using linear programming with auxiliary variables. We can use pulp or pyomo. But we can use cvxpy with 'ECOS' but maybe we can precompute some matrices and use cvxpy's matrix operations to speed up.

But the main time is solving the optimization. For K=35, it's small. So baseline is fine. But we need to produce a solver that runs faster. We can use cvxpy with 'ECOS' but set 'max_iters' to something small? But we need optimal solution. We can use 'ECOS' with 'abstol' and 'reltol' small.

Alternatively, we can use cvxpy with 'SCS' which is faster for small problems. Let's try to use 'SCS' with 'max_iters' maybe 1000. But we need to ensure optimality within tolerance.

We can also use 'OSQP' by converting to quadratic objective: minimize sum of squared norms? But that's not same objective.

We can also use 'cvxpy' with 'ECOS' but set 'verbose=False', 'max_iters' maybe 1000. But baseline may already be fast.

But we can also use 'cvxpy' with 'SCS' and 'eps' small.

Alternatively, we can use 'cvxpy' with 'ECOS' but use 'solver=cp.ECOS' and 'solver_opts={'max_iters': 1000, 'abstol':1e-8, 'reltol':1e-8}'. That might be faster.

But we can also use 'cvxpy' with 'SCS' and 'max_iters': 5000.

But we can also use 'cvxpy' with 'ECOS' and 'max_iters': 5000.

But we can also use 'cvxpy' with 'OSQP' by linearizing the norm with auxiliary variables and using linear constraints? Actually OSQP can handle quadratic objective but not second-order cone constraints. But we can transform the norm constraint into linear constraints using epigraph of l2 norm? That requires second-order cone. So OSQP cannot handle that.

Thus we need a SOCP solver. ECOS and SCS can handle that.

We can also use 'cvxpy' with 'SCS' which is faster for small problems.

Let's implement solve using cvxpy with SCS solver. We'll set 'verbose': False, 'max_iters': 5000, 'eps': 1e-6.

Also we can precompute some matrices to reduce overhead? But not necessary.

We can also use 'cvxpy' with 'ECOS' but set 'max_iters': 5000.

We can also use 'cvxpy' with 'SCS' and 'max_iters': 5000.

Let's choose SCS.

Also we can use 'cvxpy' with 'SCS' and 'eps': 1e-5.

We need to import cvxpy as cp, numpy as np.

We need to return same output format.

We need to compute fuel consumption as gamma * sum(norm(F)). We can compute after solving.

We need to handle solver errors.

We need to ensure we use cp.Problem(objective, constraints).solve(solver=cp.SCS, verbose=False, max_iters=5000, eps=1e-5). But SCS may not support 'max_iters' param? It does: 'max_iters' is a solver option.

We can also use 'SCS' with 'eps': 1e-5.

We need to check if prob.status in {cp.OPTIMAL, cp.OPTIMAL_INACCURATE}.

Return solution.

We need to ensure we convert to lists.

We need to import typing.Any.

We need to define class Solver with solve method.

We need to include sentinel lines.

We need to ensure no extra prints.

We need to ensure we don't import logging? Not necessary.

We can just catch exceptions.

We can also use 'cp.SCS' solver.

Let's implement.

Potential improvement: Use cvxpy's 'cp.Variable' with shape (K+1,3) etc.

We can also use 'cp.norm' with axis=1.

We can also use 'cp.sum' of norms.

We can also use 'cp.norm' for each F.

We can also use 'cp.norm' for each F.

We can also use 'cp.norm' for each F.

Ok.

Let's implement.

We need to ensure we import typing.Any.

We need to ensure we import cvxpy as cp.

We need to ensure we import numpy.

We need to ensure we import typing.Any.

We need to ensure we return empty lists if fails.

We need to ensure we compute fuel consumption.

We need to ensure we return dictionary with keys: position, velocity, thrust, fuel_consumption.

We need to ensure we convert to lists.

Ok.

Let's write code.

Potential improvement: Use 'cp.norm' with axis=1.

Ok.

Let's produce final code.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
