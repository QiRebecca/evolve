analysisWe need to produce solver.py that solves BTSP efficiently. Baseline uses networkx BottleneckTSPSolver. We can implement a faster algorithm: Since objective is minimize maximum edge weight in Hamiltonian cycle. Equivalent to find minimal threshold T such that graph with edges <= T has a Hamiltonian cycle. Since graph is complete weighted, we can binary search on T. For each threshold, we need to check if there exists Hamiltonian cycle in subgraph of edges <= T. That's NP-hard. But maybe for small n? But we need efficient for typical sizes. Maybe we can use Held-Karp DP with bitmask to compute minimal bottleneck? We can compute minimal bottleneck via DP: dp[mask][i] = minimal possible bottleneck for path covering mask ending at i. Transition: dp[mask|1<<j][j] = min(max(dp[mask][i], w[i][j]), ...). Finally, cycle: min over i of max(dp[full][i], w[i][0]). Complexity O(n^2 * 2^n). For n up to maybe 15-20. But unknown. Baseline uses networkx algorithm maybe also exponential. So we can implement DP.

We need to return tour list. We can reconstruct path by storing predecessor.

Implement solve: if n <= 1 return [0,0]. Use DP arrays of size 2^n x n. Use large float for INF. Use list of lists. Use bit operations.

Reconstruction: after computing best bottleneck, we need to reconstruct path. We can store parent[mask][i] = previous node. For each transition, if new bottleneck < current dp[mask|1<<j][j], update parent.

At end, find best end node i that gives minimal bottleneck for cycle. Then reconstruct path backwards: start from full mask, end node i. Build list reversed. Then add 0 at start and end.

Edge weights from problem matrix.

Return list.

Complexities: memory 2^n * n. For n=20, 1M * 20 ~ 20M entries, maybe heavy but okay. For n=25, 33M entries, heavy. But baseline may handle up to maybe 20. We'll assume.

Implement using Python lists of floats. Use bitmask loops.

Pseudo:

n = len(problem)
full = (1<<n)-1
dp = [[float('inf')]*n for _ in range(1<<n)]
parent = [[-1]*n for _ in range(1<<n)]
dp[1][0] = 0  # start at 0
for mask in range(1<<n):
    if not (mask & 1): continue
    for i in range(n):
        if not (mask & (1<<i)): continue
        cur = dp[mask][i]
        if cur==float('inf'): continue
        for j in range(n):
            if mask & (1<<j): continue
            newmask = mask | (1<<j)
            newbottleneck = max(cur, problem[i][j])
            if newbottleneck < dp[newmask][j]:
                dp[newmask][j] = newbottleneck
                parent[newmask][j] = i

After DP, find best end node i minimizing max(dp[full][i], problem[i][0]). best_bottleneck = inf; best_end = -1
for i in range(n):
    if i==0: continue
    bottleneck = max(dp[full][i], problem[i][0])
    if bottleneck < best_bottleneck:
        best_bottleneck = bottleneck
        best_end = i

If best_end==-1: return []

Reconstruct path: path = [0]
mask = full
cur = best_end
while cur != 0:
    path.append(cur)
    prev = parent[mask][cur]
    mask ^= (1<<cur)
    cur = prev
path.append(0)
path.reverse()
return path

Edge case n=1: return [0,0].

Return list of ints.

We need to import typing.Any.

Also need to import itertools? Not needed.

Return type Any.

Implement class Solver.
