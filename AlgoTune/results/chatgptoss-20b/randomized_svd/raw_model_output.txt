analysisWe need to implement a solver that uses randomized SVD. The baseline uses sklearn's randomized_svd. We can use sklearn? Not listed. But we have numpy, scipy. We can implement randomized SVD ourselves or use scipy.sparse.linalg.svds? But that is for sparse matrices. We can implement a simple randomized SVD: generate random Gaussian matrix Omega of size m x (k+p), compute Y = A @ Omega, orthonormalize Y via QR, compute B = Q^T @ A, compute SVD of B (small), then U = Q @ U_small, V = V_small. Use power iterations n_iter. That should be efficient.

We need to match output shapes: U shape (n,k), S shape (k,), V shape (m,k). We need to ensure orthonormal columns. Use numpy.linalg.svd on small B.

We need to handle matrix_type to set n_iter: 10 if ill_conditioned else 5. Problem dict includes matrix_type. Also matrix is given as list of lists? In baseline, they pass A = problem["matrix"] which is likely a numpy array? In is_solution, they convert solution arrays to np.asarray. For A, they use A = problem["matrix"] and then A.shape. So problem["matrix"] must be a numpy array. In input example, matrix is list of lists. But harness likely converts to numpy array. We'll assume A is numpy array.

Implement solve: read A, n_components, matrix_type. Determine n_iter. Use random_state=42 for reproducibility. Use numpy.random.default_rng(42). Use oversampling p=5 or 10? Standard uses p=5. We'll set p = min(5, n_components). Actually oversample to k+5. Use p=5. So l = k + p. Ensure l <= min(n,m). If l > min(n,m), set l = min(n,m). Then generate Omega shape (m, l). Compute Y = A @ Omega. Then power iterations: for i in range(n_iter): Y = A @ (A.T @ Y). Then QR: Q, _ = np.linalg.qr(Y, mode='reduced'). Then B = Q.T @ A. Compute small SVD: U_small, s, Vt_small = np.linalg.svd(B, full_matrices=False). Then U = Q @ U_small. V = Vt_small.T. Return dict.

Need to ensure shapes: U (n,k), V (m,k). s shape (k,). Ensure s sorted descending. SVD returns descending. Good.

Edge cases: if k > min(n,m), set k = min(n,m). But problem likely ensures k <= min(n,m). We'll guard.

Implement.

Also need to import numpy as np, from typing import Any.

Return dict with lists? The baseline returns numpy arrays. is_solution converts to np.asarray. So we can return numpy arrays. Good.

Implement.

Let's write solver.py accordingly.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
