analysisWe need to produce solver.py with a fast solver for Minimum Dominating Set. Baseline uses CP-SAT. We can try to use a greedy approximation? But must be optimal. We need to produce optimal solution. We can use ILP with pulp or ortools? CP-SAT is already optimal. But we can maybe use a faster solver like networkx's algorithm? But we need optimal. For small graphs, CP-SAT is fine. But we need to optimize runtime. We can use a faster solver like OR-Tools CP-SAT but with some heuristics? We can use a branch and bound with bitmask DP for small n <= maybe 30? But unknown size. We can use a simple exact algorithm: use recursion with pruning, using bitmask representation. For n up to maybe 50, we can use a branch and bound with bit operations. Use adjacency bitmask for each node. Then we can use a recursive search: choose a node not yet dominated, branch on including it or not? Standard algorithm for dominating set: choose a node v not dominated, then either include v or include one of its neighbors. Use recursion with pruning by current size + lower bound. Lower bound: number of undominated nodes / max degree+1? Use simple bound: ceil(undominated / (max_degree+1)). That might prune.

We need to handle up to maybe 100 nodes? Might be heavy. But CP-SAT might be slower for large graphs. But we can use a simple greedy to get an upper bound, then branch and bound.

Implement:

- Precompute adjacency bitmask for each node: neighbors + itself.

- Initially dominated = 0.

- Use recursion function dfs(dominated_mask, chosen_mask, depth). Keep best solution size and best mask.

- If dominated_mask == all_ones: update best.

- If depth >= best_size: prune.

- Compute lower bound: remaining = all_ones ^ dominated_mask. Count bits. max_cover = max(cover_size of any node) maybe precomputed. Lower bound = ceil(remaining_bits / max_cover). If depth + lower_bound >= best_size: prune.

- Choose a node v not dominated: pick lowest bit in remaining.

- Branch: include v: new_dominated = dominated_mask | cover[v]; new_chosen = chosen_mask | (1<<v); dfs(new_dominated, new_chosen, depth+1).

- Also branch: include each neighbor of v (including v itself? Already included). Actually we already include v. For other branch, we can include a neighbor u of v (including v? but we already did). So we need to branch on neighbors of v: for each u in neighbors[v] (including v?), but we already did v. So for each u in neighbors[v] (excluding v), include u. But we might double count. But we can just branch on each neighbor u: new_dominated = dominated_mask | cover[u]; new_chosen = chosen_mask | (1<<u); dfs(..., depth+1). But we might include v again? But we skip v.

- This algorithm is standard.

We need to compute cover[v] = adjacency_mask[v] | (1<<v). Precompute.

We also need to compute max_cover = max(len bits of cover[v]) maybe.

We also need to compute lower bound: ceil(remaining_bits / max_cover). But max_cover might be too optimistic if we cannot cover all remaining with same node. But it's okay for pruning.

We also need to compute a greedy upper bound: run a simple greedy algorithm: while not all dominated, pick node with max uncovered neighbors. That gives an upper bound.

Implement bit operations using Python integers. For n up to maybe 64, it's fine. For >64, Python int can handle arbitrary bits.

We need to convert solution mask to list of indices.

We need to handle recursion depth maybe large; but we can use iterative? But recursion fine.

We need to set recursion limit maybe.

We need to store best_mask and best_size.

We need to use bit_count method (Python 3.8+). Use int.bit_count().

We need to parse problem adjacency matrix: list of lists of ints.

We need to ensure graph is symmetric but we can ignore.

Implement solve method.

We need to import Any.

We need to define class Solver.

We need to ensure we don't use external packages.

We need to ensure we don't exceed time. For moderate n, this algorithm might be okay.

We can also add a time limit? Not needed.

Let's implement.

Potential improvements: Use ordering of nodes by degree descending to branch first on high-degree nodes.

In recursion, when picking v, we can choose the node with smallest degree among uncovered? Standard algorithm chooses a node with smallest degree to reduce branching. But we can just pick first uncovered.

We can also precompute neighbor lists.

Let's implement.

Edge cases: n=0? Return [].

Let's code.

We need to ensure we don't exceed recursion limit for n maybe 100. Depth <= best_size <= n. So recursion depth <= n. Python default recursion limit 1000, fine.

Let's implement.

We need to store best_size as global variable.

We need to use closure or nested function.

Let's code.

Also we can use caching? Not necessary.

Let's produce final code.

We need to output only solver.py content between sentinel lines.

Let's produce.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
