analysisWe need to write solver.py that solves Chebyshev center problem faster than CVXPY. We can formulate as linear program: maximize r subject to a_i^T x + r * ||a_i|| <= b_i. This is linear in x and r. We can solve using linear programming solver like pulp or scipy.optimize.linprog. Use scipy.optimize.linprog which is fast. We need to set up objective: maximize r => minimize -r. Variables: x (n), r (1). Constraints: a_i^T x + r * norm_i <= b_i. Also r >= 0. So we have m constraints plus one nonnegativity for r. We can incorporate r >= 0 as constraint: -r <= 0? Actually r >= 0 => -r <= 0. So we can add constraint -r <= 0. Also we need bounds: x free? In LP, variables can be free. In linprog, we can set bounds for each variable. For x, bounds None (unbounded). For r, bounds (0, None). So we set bounds list: for each x variable: (None, None). For r: (0, None). Then constraints: A_ub x + b_ub? Actually linprog expects A_ub @ x <= b_ub. Our variables vector is [x1,...,xn, r]. So we need to build A_ub matrix of shape (m+1, n+1). For each i: a_i^T for x part, norm_i for r part. So row: [a_i, norm_i]. b_ub: b_i. For r>=0 constraint: -r <= 0 => row: [0,...,0, -1], b_ub: 0. Objective: minimize -r => c vector: zeros for x, -1 for r. Then call linprog with method='highs' (fast). After solving, get solution x. Return {"solution": x_value.tolist()}. Need to ensure solution is real numbers. Also check status. Use res.success. If not success, maybe fallback to CVXPY? But baseline expects optimal. We'll assume success.

Edge cases: a shape maybe 1D? But a is list of lists. We'll convert to np.array. Norms: np.linalg.norm(a, axis=1). Use float.

Return solution as list of floats. Ensure rounding? Not necessary.

Implement class Solver with solve method.

Also import numpy as np, scipy.optimize.linprog.

Add typing import Any.

Let's craft code.

Also we need to ensure that the solver returns same solution as baseline within tolerance. Since LP is same, should match.

Potential difference: baseline uses CLARABEL solver, but our solution may produce slightly different due to numerical differences. But is_solution compares radii, not center. So as long as radius matches within tolerance, it's fine. But we need to ensure we compute center that yields same radius. Since LP is same, solution should be same.

Let's implement.

Also we need to handle case where a is 1D? But m constraints. We'll assume a shape (m, n). If m=1, shape (1,n). Works.

Implement.

Also we need to import typing.Any.

Return type Any.

Let's produce final code.
