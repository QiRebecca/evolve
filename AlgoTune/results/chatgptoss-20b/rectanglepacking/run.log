    We must output full solver.py content. We need to implement solve that returns list of RectanglePlacement? But baseline returns list[RectanglePlacement] where RectanglePlacement is a namedtuple? We need to import or define? In baseline, they use RectanglePlacement class defined elsewhere. We need to match expected output format: list of tuples? The validator expects solution as list[RectanglePlacement] where each element is a tuple? In validator, they iterate solution as r_p[0] etc. So solution is list of tuples (index, x, y, rotated). So we can return list of tuples.
