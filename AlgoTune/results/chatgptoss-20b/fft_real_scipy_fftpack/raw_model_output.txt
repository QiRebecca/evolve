analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method computing FFT. Baseline uses scipy.fftpack.fftn. We can use numpy.fft.fftn which is faster? Actually numpy's FFT is efficient. Use np.fft.fftn. Should be fine. We need to import numpy as np. Also typing Any. Provide class Solver with solve method. Should accept problem: NDArray. We can just return np.fft.fftn(problem). That matches reference. Should be fast. Use numpy. Also maybe use np.fft.fftn with norm? But baseline uses scipy.fftpack.fftn. That is similar. Use numpy. Should be fine.

We need to output only the file content between sentinel lines. Ensure no extra whitespace. Provide code. Let's craft.

Also ensure we import numpy. Use from typing import Any. Provide class Solver. Provide solve method. Accept problem, **kwargs. Return np.fft.fftn(problem). That's it.

Let's produce.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Compute the N-dimensional FFT using numpy's FFT implementation.
        """
        return np.fft.fftn(problem)
