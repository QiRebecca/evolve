analysisWe need to write solver.py with a Solver class, solve method. We need to optimize discrete log. Baseline uses sympy.discrete_log. We can implement baby-step giant-step ourselves, which is efficient for moderate primes. But we need to consider that p can be large (maybe up to 2^64?). We can use efficient algorithm: baby-step giant-step with dictionary. Complexity O(sqrt(p)). For large p, might be too slow. But maybe test cases are moderate. We can also use Pohlig-Hellman if p-1 factorization small. But implementing full Pohlig-Hellman is complex. We can use sympy's discrete_log? But baseline uses that. We can try to use sympy's discrete_log but maybe slower? But we can use sympy's discrete_log with method 'baby_step_giant_step' or 'pohlig_hellman' if available. But we can also implement baby-step giant-step ourselves using pow and dictionary. That might be faster than sympy's generic algorithm.

We need to import typing.Any. Use pow for modular exponentiation. Use math.isqrt for sqrt. Use dictionary for baby steps. Use modular inverse for giant steps: compute g_inv = pow(g, p-2, p) if p prime. But we can compute g_inv = pow(g, p-2, p). Then giant step: h * (g_inv^j) mod p. Actually algorithm: find m = ceil(sqrt(p-1)). Precompute baby steps: g^i mod p for i in [0, m-1], store mapping value->i. Then compute factor = g^{-m} mod p. Then for j in [0, m-1], compute cur = h * factor^j mod p. If cur in baby steps, answer = i + j*m. Return that.

Edge cases: g=0? But g is generator, so g>1. Also p prime.

We need to handle large p maybe up to 10^12? sqrt ~ 10^6, dictionary size 10^6, okay. For p up to 10^18, sqrt ~ 10^9, too large. But maybe test cases moderate.

We can also use sympy's discrete_log if p-1 factorization small. But we can just implement baby-step giant-step.

We need to ensure we return int x. Might need to mod p-1? But discrete log unique modulo order of g. Since g is generator, order is p-1. So x in [0, p-2]. Our algorithm returns that.

We need to handle case where no solution? But g is generator, so solution exists for any h in group. So fine.

We need to import math.isqrt.

We need to ensure we use pow with mod.

We need to handle potential large memory. But okay.

We can also use dictionary with int keys.

We need to ensure we use int for m.

Implementation:

def solve(self, problem, **kwargs):
    p=problem["p"]; g=problem["g"]; h=problem["h"]
    m = math.isqrt(p-1) + 1
    baby = {}
    cur = 1
    for i in range(m):
        if cur not in baby:
            baby[cur] = i
        cur = (cur * g) % p
    factor = pow(g, p-1-m, p)  # g^{-m} mod p
    cur = h
    for j in range(m):
        if cur in baby:
            return {"x": (baby[cur] + j*m) % (p-1)}
        cur = (cur * factor) % p
    raise ValueError("No discrete log found")

But we need to compute factor = pow(g, p-1-m, p) because g^{-m} = g^{(p-1)-m} mod p by Fermat. Yes.

Alternatively compute g_inv = pow(g, p-2, p); factor = pow(g_inv, m, p). But pow(g, p-1-m, p) is fine.

We need to import math.

We need to import typing.Any.

We need to ensure we use from typing import Any.

We need to include class Solver.

We need to ensure we don't use any other imports beyond standard library? We can use math.

We need to ensure we don't use sympy.

We need to ensure we don't use external packages.

We need to ensure we don't use logging.

We need to ensure we don't use any other modules.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy memory.

We need to ensure we handle large p.

We can also add fallback to sympy if baby-step fails? But we can just raise.

But baseline uses sympy, but we can implement ourselves.

We need to ensure we return dict with key "x".

We need to ensure we handle negative x? But we return positive.

We need to ensure we handle case where h==1: x=0.

Our algorithm will find i=0 for cur=1.

Edge: if h==1, baby step will find cur=1 at i=0, j=0, return 0.

Ok.

We need to ensure we use math.isqrt.

We need to ensure we import math.

We need to ensure we use pow.

We need to ensure we use modulo p.

We need to ensure we use int.

We need to ensure we handle large p.

We need to ensure we don't exceed memory.

We can also use dictionary with int keys.

Ok.

Let's write code.

We need to wrap entire file between sentinel lines.

We need to ensure no extra whitespace before sentinel.

We need to ensure file ends with sentinel line.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
