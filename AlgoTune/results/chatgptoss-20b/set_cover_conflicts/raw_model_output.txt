We need to implement a faster solver than baseline. Use CP-SAT? baseline uses cp_model from ortools. We can use same but maybe add heuristics? But we can also use ILP with pulp? But CP-SAT is efficient. Maybe we can use a greedy algorithm with branch and bound? But we need optimal solution. Could use MILP with pulp? Might be slower.

We can use OR-Tools CP-SAT but with some improvements: add symmetry breaking? But baseline already minimal.

We can also use a simple branch and bound with recursion and pruning using lower bound from set cover greedy. That might be faster for small instances.

But we don't know instance size. Use CP-SAT but with some additional constraints: add all-different? Not.

Maybe we can use a simple heuristic to get good solution quickly, then use CP-SAT with time limit to improve? But we need optimal.

We can use CP-SAT with a time limit of 1 second? But baseline may be fine.

We can also use a custom solver: use python's pulp with CBC? Might be slower.

Maybe we can use a simple ILP with Gurobi? Not available.

We can use OR-Tools CP-SAT but with a custom search strategy: set variable selection to min domain? Already.

We can also use a simple branch and bound with recursion and caching. Let's implement a recursive backtracking with pruning: maintain uncovered objects, selected sets, conflict sets. Use lower bound: greedy set cover on remaining objects ignoring conflicts. If current + lower bound >= best, prune. This can be efficient.

Implement:

- Preprocess: for each object, list of sets covering it.

- For conflicts: store as list of sets of indices.

- Use recursion: choose an uncovered object, try each set covering it that doesn't conflict with already selected sets. For each, add set, update uncovered, update conflicts. Use lower bound: compute greedy cover of remaining uncovered objects ignoring conflicts but with available sets that don't conflict with selected sets? Actually we can compute lower bound by greedy ignoring conflicts but still respecting that selected sets cannot conflict with future sets? Hard.

Simpler: use greedy set cover ignoring conflicts to get lower bound. That may be optimistic but still valid lower bound? It might underestimate because conflicts may restrict. But it's still a lower bound? Actually ignoring conflicts may allow selecting conflicting sets, so it might produce a smaller number than feasible, so it's not a valid lower bound. So cannot prune.

We need a valid lower bound: we can compute maximum matching? Hard.

Thus CP-SAT may be best.

We can use CP-SAT but add a time limit and use the solution found as final. But we need optimal. But CP-SAT will find optimal.

Maybe we can use a faster solver: use OR-Tools CP-SAT but with a custom search order: set variables with highest coverage first. That may speed up.

Implement: compute coverage count for each set. Sort sets by coverage descending. Create variables in that order. Add constraints. Use solver parameters: log search? Not.

Also add a global constraint: at most one of each conflict. Already.

We can also add a constraint: sum of set_vars >= lower bound from greedy. That can prune.

Compute greedy lower bound: run greedy set cover ignoring conflicts. That gives a number of sets. That is a lower bound? Actually greedy ignoring conflicts may produce a solution that may not be feasible due to conflicts, but the number of sets may be less than optimal, so it's not a lower bound. But we can use it as an upper bound to prune search: if current number of selected sets + remaining sets needed > best, prune. But we need best known solution. We can run greedy to get an initial solution as upper bound. Then CP-SAT can use that as objective bound.

We can use CP-SAT with a time limit and set objective to minimize. It will find optimal anyway.

Thus implement baseline but with some improvements: use variable ordering by coverage, add initial solution from greedy to set objective bound.

Implement greedy: while uncovered objects exist, pick set covering most uncovered objects. Add to solution. Ensure no conflicts? We ignore conflicts, but we can still use as upper bound. But if greedy picks conflicting sets, the solution may be invalid. But we can still use as upper bound? It may not be feasible, so cannot use as upper bound. So we need a feasible solution. We can use trivial solution: each object individually. That is always feasible. So upper bound = n. But we can try to improve by greedy that respects conflicts: we can greedily pick sets that don't conflict with already selected sets. That may produce a feasible solution. That can be used as upper bound.

Implement greedy with conflict check: maintain selected sets, for each uncovered object, choose set that covers most uncovered objects and doesn't conflict with selected sets. That may produce a feasible solution. Use that as initial solution.

Then CP-SAT can use that as objective bound: set objective to minimize sum, and set solver parameters: set objective bound to len(initial_solution). That will prune search.

Also we can set solver parameters: solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 10? But we don't want time limit.

But we can set solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8 to parallelize.

Implement.
