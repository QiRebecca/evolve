analysisWe need to produce solver.py content. The baseline uses cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes. We can optimize by using hashlib.sha256 which is faster. But we must use cryptography? The task says uses cryptography library. But we can still use hashlib? The baseline uses cryptography, but the solution must produce same output. Using hashlib will produce same digest. It's allowed? The problem statement says "This tasks uses the cryptography library." But not mandatory. But to be safe, we can use cryptography but maybe faster? cryptography's Hash is slower than hashlib. So we can use hashlib.sha256. That will produce same digest. Should be fine.

We need to import Any. Use typing.Any. Provide solve method. Should accept problem dict with key "plaintext" bytes. Return dict with "digest" bytes.

We can also use memoryview to avoid copying? But hashlib.update accepts bytes-like. So just do hashlib.sha256(plaintext).digest().

We need to handle errors? Not necessary. But we can wrap in try/except and raise.

Return {"digest": hash_value}.

Also we need to import hashlib.

Let's produce code:

from typing import Any
import hashlib

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        plaintext = problem["plaintext"]
        hash_value = hashlib.sha256(plaintext).digest()
        return {"digest": hash_value}

That's it.

Wrap with sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
