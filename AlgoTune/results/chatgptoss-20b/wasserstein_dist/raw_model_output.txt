analysisWe need to implement a fast solver for Wasserstein distance between two discrete distributions on support 1..n. The baseline uses scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance which uses efficient algorithm. We can implement our own algorithm: For 1D distributions, the Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover's Distance) can be computed as sum over cumulative differences times distance. For discrete distributions on sorted support, the formula: Let F_u(k) = sum_{i=1}^k u_i, F_v(k) = sum_{i=1}^k v_i. Then Wasserstein distance = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |F_u(k) - F_v(k)|. Actually for 1D with unit distance between adjacent points, the cost is sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |F_u(k) - F_v(k)|. But if support points are 1..n, distance between i and j is |i-j|. The formula holds. So we can compute cumulative sums and sum absolute differences. Complexity O(n). That is faster than calling scipy.

Edge cases: distributions may not sum to 1? But they are probability distributions. But we can handle any nonnegative arrays.

Implementation: In solve, get u, v lists. Convert to numpy arrays for speed. Compute cumulative sums. Compute abs diff. Sum. Return float.

We need to import typing.Any. Also maybe import numpy as np. Use np.array. Use np.cumsum. Use np.abs. Use float(np.sum(...)). That should be fine.

We need to handle errors: if problem missing keys, return len(u). But baseline returns len(problem["u"]). We can mimic that.

Also we need to import logging? Not necessary. But baseline uses logging. We can ignore.

Implement:

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        try:
            u = np.array(problem["u"], dtype=float)
            v = np.array(problem["v"], dtype=float)
            if u.shape != v.shape:
                return float(len(u))
            cum_u = np.cumsum(u)
            cum_v = np.cumsum(v)
            # exclude last element because difference at n is zero
            diff = np.abs(cum_u[:-1] - cum_v[:-1])
            return float(np.sum(diff))
        except Exception:
            return float(len(problem.get("u", [])))

Return float.

We need to import numpy. Also typing.Any.

Let's produce solver.py content accordingly.

        Compute the Wasserstein distance between two discrete distributions
        defined on the support {1, 2, ..., n}.

        The distance is computed efficiently using cumulative sums:
            d = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |C_u(k) - C_v(k)|
        where C_u(k) = sum_{i=1}^k u_i and similarly for C_v.

        Parameters
        ----------
        problem : dict
            Dictionary with keys 'u' and 'v', each a list of floats.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The Wasserstein distance.
