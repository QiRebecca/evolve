analysisWe need to implement a fast rotation. Use scipy.ndimage.rotate is baseline. We can use scipy.ndimage.rotate but maybe faster? We can use skimage.transform.rotate? But we only have scipy. We can use numpy and scipy's map_coordinates for interpolation. But maybe simpler: use scipy.ndimage.rotate directly. But we can set reshape=False, order=3, mode='constant', cval=0.0. The baseline uses self.reshape, self.order, self.mode. We need to set these attributes. In our Solver class, we can set defaults: reshape=False, order=3, mode='constant'. Use scipy.ndimage.rotate. That should be fine. But we need to import scipy.ndimage. Use numpy. The solve method returns dict with rotated_image as list? The baseline returns rotated_image as array. The is_solution expects list or array convertible. It will convert to array. So we can return numpy array. But to be safe, we can convert to list? But conversion to list may be slower. But okay. We can return numpy array. The is_solution will convert to array. So fine.

We need to import logging? Not necessary. But we can ignore.

We need to ensure we don't exceed time. Use numpy array. Use scipy.ndimage.rotate. That is fine.

Implement class Solver with solve method. Use default attributes. Provide __init__? Not required. But we can set attributes in solve. But baseline uses self.reshape etc. We can set them as class attributes. Let's set class attributes: reshape=False, order=3, mode='constant'. In solve, we call scipy.ndimage.rotate(image, angle, reshape=self.reshape, order=self.order, mode=self.mode). That returns array. Return {"rotated_image": rotated_image}. That should pass.

We need to import from typing import Any. Also import numpy as np, scipy.ndimage. Provide code.

Let's produce solver.py content.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np
import scipy.ndimage

class Solver:
    reshape: bool = False
    order: int = 3
    mode: str = 'constant'

    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        image = problem["image"]
        angle = problem["angle"]
        rotated_image = scipy.ndimage.rotate(
            image, angle, reshape=self.reshape, order=self.order, mode=self.mode
        )
        return {"rotated_image": rotated_image}
