analysisWe need to produce solver.py that compresses using gzip with deterministic settings. Baseline uses gzip.compress(plaintext, compresslevel=9, mtime=0). We can just replicate that. But we can try to optimize speed: maybe use zlib directly? But gzip.compress is efficient. We can also use gzip.GzipFile with BytesIO. But compresslevel 9 is slow. But baseline uses compresslevel 9. We need to produce same output length <= baseline. We can try to use zlib.compress with wbits=31 to produce gzip header? But easier to just call gzip.compress. That should be fine.

We need to import gzip, logging? Not necessary. But we can import gzip. The function signature: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any. We need to return dict with 'compressed_data': bytes.

We need to import Any from typing.

We need to ensure we set mtime=0. gzip.compress supports mtime param in Python 3.9+. We'll use that.

We can also add try/except but not necessary.

We need to ensure we don't import logging unless used. Not needed.

Thus solver.py content:

from typing import Any
import gzip

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        plaintext = problem["plaintext"]
        compressed_data = gzip.compress(plaintext, compresslevel=9, mtime=0)
        return {"compressed_data": compressed_data}

That's it.

Wrap with sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
