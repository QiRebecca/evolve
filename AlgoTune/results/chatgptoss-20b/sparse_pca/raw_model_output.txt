analysisWe need to produce a solver that is faster than baseline. Baseline uses CVXPY to solve convex problem with L1 penalty and norm constraints. We can solve analytically? Problem: minimize ||B - X||_F^2 + λ ||X||_1 subject to ||X_i||_2 <= 1. This is separable across columns? Objective sum over columns: sum_i (||B_i - X_i||^2 + λ ||X_i||_1). Constraint per column: ||X_i||_2 <= 1. So each column independent. So we can solve each column separately: minimize f_i(x) = ||b - x||^2 + λ ||x||_1 subject to ||x||_2 <= 1. This is convex. We can solve via proximal operator of L1 with box? Actually constraint is Euclidean norm <=1. Equivalent to projection onto unit ball after soft-thresholding? Let's think: unconstrained minimizer of ||b - x||^2 + λ ||x||_1 is soft-thresholding: x* = S(b, λ/2?) Wait objective: ||b - x||^2 = (x - b)^T(x - b). Minimization of (x - b)^T(x - b) + λ ||x||_1. This is separable: minimize over each coordinate: (x_j - b_j)^2 + λ |x_j|. The solution is soft-thresholding: x_j = sign(b_j) * max(|b_j| - λ/2, 0). Because derivative: 2(x_j - b_j) + λ sign(x_j) = 0 => x_j = b_j - λ/2 sign(x_j). But if |b_j| <= λ/2, then x_j=0. So threshold λ/2. So unconstrained solution x_un = soft(b, λ/2). Then we need to enforce ||x||_2 <= 1. If ||x_un||_2 <= 1, it's optimal. If >1, we need to project onto unit ball: minimize ||x - x_un||^2 subject to ||x||_2 <=1. That projection is scaling: x = x_un / ||x_un||_2. But does that preserve optimality? We need to solve constrained problem: minimize f(x) = ||b - x||^2 + λ ||x||_1 subject to ||x||_2 <=1. This is convex but not separable due to constraint. However we can use Lagrangian: minimize over x: ||b - x||^2 + λ ||x||_1 + μ (||x||_2^2 -1) with μ>=0. For μ>0, solution is soft-thresholding of b/(1+μ). Wait: derivative: 2(x - b) + λ sign(x) + 2 μ x = 0 => (2+2μ)x + λ sign(x) = 2b => x = (b - (λ/2) sign(x))/(1+μ). But sign(x) depends on x. This is similar to soft-thresholding with shrinkage factor 1/(1+μ). So solution is x = S(b/(1+μ), λ/(2(1+μ))). Then we need to find μ such that ||x||_2 =1 if unconstrained solution violates. This is similar to projected soft-thresholding. We can solve for μ via root finding. But maybe simpler: compute unconstrained x_un. If its norm <=1, return x_un. Else, we need to find μ>0 such that ||S(b/(1+μ), λ/(2(1+μ)))||_2 =1. This can be solved via binary search on μ. Since dimension n up to maybe 100? We can do per column.

Alternatively, we can use cvxpy but that is slow. So implement this algorithm.

Implementation steps:

- For each column i:
    - b = B[:, i]
    - Compute soft-thresholding with threshold λ/2: x_un = np.sign(b) * np.maximum(np.abs(b) - λ/2, 0)
    - If np.linalg.norm(x_un) <= 1: set X[:, i] = x_un
    - Else:
        - Need to find μ such that norm of x(μ) =1.
        - Define function g(μ) = ||S(b/(1+μ), λ/(2(1+μ)))||_2 - 1
        - g(0) = ||x_un||_2 -1 >0
        - As μ→∞, b/(1+μ)→0, threshold λ/(2(1+μ))→0, so S→0, norm→0-1 negative. So root exists.
        - Use binary search on μ in [0, high] where high large enough. We can double high until g(high)<0.
        - Then binary search to tolerance 1e-8.

- After obtaining X, compute explained_variance: for each component, var = X[:,i].T @ A @ X[:,i].

Return components as list of lists.

Need to import numpy, typing.Any.

Edge cases: n_components may be > number of eigenvectors? B has shape (n, k). But we need X shape (n, n_components). In baseline, they set B to k columns, but constraints for all n_components. If n_components > k, B has fewer columns. In objective, they use B - X, but B has fewer columns? Actually B shape (n, k). X shape (n, n_components). In cp, they use B - X, but shapes mismatch? But maybe they rely on broadcasting? In cp, B - X will broadcast B to (n, n_components) by repeating columns? Not sure. But we can mimic: if n_components > k, we can pad B with zeros for remaining columns. So B_padded = np.hstack([B, np.zeros((n, n_components - k))]) if n_components > k else B[:, :n_components]. That ensures shape matches.

Also if k=0 (no positive eigenvalues), B zeros.

Implement accordingly.

Complexities: O(n * n_components * log(1/eps)). Should be fast.

Let's code.

Also need to handle case where λ is zero: then soft-thresholding threshold 0, so x_un = b. If norm >1, we need to project onto unit ball: x = b / ||b||. That is same as μ>0 solution with λ=0. Our algorithm will handle.

Implement function soft_threshold(b, thresh): np.sign(b)*np.maximum(np.abs(b)-thresh,0).

Implement g(μ): compute x = soft_threshold(b/(1+μ), λ/(2*(1+μ))) ; return np.linalg.norm(x) -1.

Binary search: low=0, high=1. While g(high)>0: high*=2. Then while high-low > tol: mid=(low+high)/2; if g(mid)>0: low=mid else high=mid. After loop, μ=high. Compute x.

Return X.

Edge: if λ very large, x_un may be zero vector, norm 0 <=1, so return zero.

Return components as list of lists: X.tolist().

Return explained_variance list.

Let's code.

Also need to import numpy as np.

Return type Any.

Let's produce solver.py content.
