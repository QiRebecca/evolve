analysisWe need to produce solver.py with a Solver class. The baseline uses np.linalg.eigvalsh. We can optimize by using numpy's efficient eigenvalue routine. For symmetric matrix, eigvalsh is efficient. But we can maybe use np.linalg.eigvals? But eigvalsh is already efficient. We can maybe use np.linalg.eigvalsh and then use np.partition to get two smallest abs values. That might be faster than sorting entire array. For large matrices, sorting all eigenvalues is O(n log n). Partition is O(n). So we can use np.partition on abs(eigenvalues) to get two smallest. But we need the actual eigenvalues, not just abs. Approach: compute eigenvalues, then use np.argpartition on abs(eigenvalues) to get indices of two smallest abs. Then get those eigenvalues, sort by abs. That avoids full sort. That should be faster.

Also we can use np.linalg.eigvalsh which returns sorted eigenvalues by default? Actually eigvalsh returns sorted ascending. But we need by absolute value. So we still need to find two with smallest abs. We can compute abs array, then use np.argpartition.

Implementation:

def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
    matrix = np.array(problem["matrix"], dtype=float)
    eigs = np.linalg.eigvalsh(matrix)
    # find indices of two smallest abs
    idx = np.argpartition(np.abs(eigs), 2)[:2]
    # get those eigenvalues
    selected = eigs[idx]
    # sort by abs
    selected_sorted = sorted(selected, key=abs)
    return selected_sorted

Edge cases: if matrix size < 2? But baseline expects at least 2. We can handle.

Also we need to import numpy as np, typing.Any.

We should also consider that np.argpartition with k=2 returns 2 smallest indices but not sorted. We then sort.

Time complexity: O(n) for eigenvalues, O(n) for argpartition, O(1) for sorting 2 elements.

We can also use np.linalg.eigvalsh which is efficient.

We can also use np.linalg.eigvals? But eigvalsh is better for symmetric.

Thus final code.

We need to output only solver.py content between sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
