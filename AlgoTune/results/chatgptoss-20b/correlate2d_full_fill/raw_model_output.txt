analysisWe need to write solver.py that implements solve method computing 2D correlation of two arrays using full mode and fill boundary. We can use scipy.signal.correlate2d or numpy's correlate? The baseline uses signal.correlate2d. We can implement faster using FFT-based convolution? For full correlation, we can use scipy.signal.fftconvolve with mode='full' and boundary? But fftconvolve doesn't support boundary fill; but we can zero-pad arrays to full size. For correlation, we need to flip one array. But we can use numpy.fft. For 2D correlation, we can compute via FFT: result = ifft2(fft2(a_padded) * fft2(b_flipped_padded)). But we need to flip b. We can use np.flipud and np.fliplr. For full mode, output size = (a.shape[0]+b.shape[0]-1, a.shape[1]+b.shape[1]-1). We can zero-pad both arrays to that size. Then compute elementwise product in frequency domain. Use np.fft.fft2 with shape equal to output size. That should be faster for large arrays. Use np.real of ifft2. Ensure dtype float64. Use np.fft.fft2 with s=output_shape. Implementation: a_padded = np.zeros(output_shape); a_padded[:a.shape[0], :a.shape[1]] = a. Similarly for b flipped. Then compute. Use np.fft.fft2(a_padded, s=output_shape) etc. Multiply. Then ifft2. Return real part. That should match. Use np.fft.fft2 and ifft2. Ensure we use np.fft.fft2 with s=output_shape. That is efficient.

Edge: large arrays maybe memory heavy but okay.

Implement solve method accordingly.

Also import numpy as np, from typing import Any.

Return np.ndarray.

Let's produce solver.py content.

We need to include sentinel lines.

Let's craft code:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        a, b = problem
        # compute full correlation via FFT
        a_shape = a.shape
        b_shape = b.shape
        out_shape = (a_shape[0] + b_shape[0] - 1, a_shape[1] + b_shape[1] - 1)
        # zero-pad a
        a_padded = np.zeros(out_shape, dtype=np.float64)
        a_padded[:a_shape[0], :a_shape[1]] = a
        # flip b
        b_flipped = np.flipud(np.fliplr(b))
        b_padded = np.zeros(out_shape, dtype=np.float64)
        b_padded[:b_shape[0], :b_shape[1]] = b_flipped
        # FFT
        A = np.fft.fft2(a_padded, s=out_shape)
        B = np.fft.fft2(b_padded, s=out_shape)
        result = np.fft.ifft2(A * B).real
        return result

We might want to cast to float64. Use np.real.

Return result.

Ok.

Let's output with sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
