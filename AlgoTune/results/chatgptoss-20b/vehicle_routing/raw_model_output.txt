We need to implement a faster solver for VRP. Baseline uses CP-SAT with MTZ. We can use OR-Tools routing solver? But we only have cp_model. Could use heuristic: solve TSP for each vehicle? But need optimal. For small n maybe CP-SAT is fine. But we need faster. Maybe use OR-Tools routing? Not available? We have ortools package. We can use ortools.constraint_solver routing solver which is efficient. Let's implement using ortools.constraint_solver routing. That will be faster.

Implement solve: use routing model with distance callback. Add vehicle count K, depot. Add dimension to enforce each node visited once. Use default search. Then extract routes.

Return list of routes.

Need to import from ortools.constraint_solver import pywrapcp, routing_enums_pb2.

Implement.

Edge case: if K > number of nodes? but fine.

Return routes.

Let's code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
