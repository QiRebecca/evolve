analysisWe need to implement a fast Lasso solver. Baseline uses sklearn Lasso. We can use scikit-learn's Lasso implementation but maybe we can use a faster algorithm like coordinate descent from sklearn but we can also use numpy to solve via cvxpy? But we need speed. For small data, sklearn is fine. But we can implement coordinate descent ourselves. But we need to match output within tolerance. We can use sklearn's Lasso with default parameters but we can set max_iter high. But baseline uses default. We can just import sklearn.linear_model.Lasso and use same. But we need to avoid overhead? The baseline uses try/except. We can replicate but maybe we can use numpy to solve via coordinate descent. But simpler: use sklearn Lasso. That will be same as baseline. But we need to ensure we import correctly. The baseline uses linear_model.Lasso. So we need to import from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso. Also need numpy. The solve method returns list of floats. We can just call Lasso. That should be fine. But we need to ensure we handle errors. The baseline uses try/except. We can replicate. But we can also use numpy to compute solution via coordinate descent. But that might be slower. So just use sklearn.

But we need to ensure we don't import heavy modules? But sklearn is available. So we can just use it.

We need to create solver.py with the class. The sentinel lines.

Let's produce:

<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
import logging

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        try:
            clf = Lasso(alpha=0.1, fit_intercept=False, max_iter=10000)
            clf.fit(problem["X"], problem["y"])
            return clf.coef_.tolist()
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
            X = np.array(problem["X"])
            _, d = X.shape
            return np.zeros(d).tolist()
