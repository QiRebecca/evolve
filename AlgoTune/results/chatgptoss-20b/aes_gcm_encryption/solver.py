analysisWe need to produce solver.py content. Implementation should match baseline but maybe faster? But baseline uses AESGCM from cryptography. We can just replicate same logic. No extra imports beyond typing.Any. But we need AESGCM, constants. We can import from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM. Also need AES_KEY_SIZES and GCM_TAG_SIZE. They were referenced in baseline; we need to define them. In baseline, AES_KEY_SIZES likely [16,24,32]. GCM_TAG_SIZE likely 16. We'll define those.

Also need logging and hmac? Not needed for solve. Only for is_solution. So we don't need logging. Just implement solve.

Return dict with ciphertext and tag.

Edge cases: associated_data may be None; AESGCM.encrypt expects bytes or None? It accepts None? In cryptography docs, associated_data can be None. So fine.

Implement.

Also need to handle errors? Not necessary.

Let's write code:

from typing import Any
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM

AES_KEY_SIZES = (16, 24, 32)
GCM_TAG_SIZE = 16

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        key = problem["key"]
        nonce = problem["nonce"]
        plaintext = problem["plaintext"]
        associated_data = problem.get("associated_data", None)

        if len(key) not in AES_KEY_SIZES:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid key size: {len(key)}. Must be one of {AES_KEY_SIZES}.")

        aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
        ciphertext_with_tag = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext, associated_data)

        if len(ciphertext_with_tag) < GCM_TAG_SIZE:
            raise ValueError("Encrypted output is shorter than the expected tag size.")

        ciphertext = ciphertext_with_tag[:-GCM_TAG_SIZE]
        tag = ciphertext_with_tag[-GCM_TAG_SIZE:]

        return {"ciphertext": ciphertext, "tag": tag}

That's all.

Ensure no other imports. Provide file content.assistantfinalfrom typing import Any
