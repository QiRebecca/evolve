analysisWe need to produce solver.py content implementing solve similar to baseline but optimized. The baseline uses AESGCM from cryptography. We can just replicate same logic. But maybe we can avoid overhead? But cryptography is fine. We can also pre-create AESGCM object? But key changes per problem. So can't reuse. But we can avoid validation? But baseline does key size check. We could skip to speed up. But is_solution will call our solve again to compare. It expects same output. So we must produce same ciphertext and tag. So we must use same algorithm. We can just implement same as baseline but maybe remove some checks. But we need to ensure correctness. We can keep minimal.

Also we need imports: from typing import Any; import logging; import hmac; from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM. Also constants: AES_KEY_SIZES, GCM_TAG_SIZE. They were referenced in baseline. We need to define them. In baseline they likely defined earlier. We can define them ourselves: AES_KEY_SIZES = (16, 24, 32); GCM_TAG_SIZE = 16. That ensures same behavior.

We also need to handle associated_data possibly None. AESGCM.encrypt expects associated_data can be None. Good.

Return dict with ciphertext and tag.

We can skip validation to speed up. But we might still want to validate key length? Not necessary for correctness. But if key length invalid, AESGCM constructor will raise ValueError. So we can rely on that. So we can skip manual check.

Thus implement:

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        key=problem["key"]; nonce=problem["nonce"]; plaintext=problem["plaintext"]; associated_data=problem.get("associated_data", None)
        aesgcm=AESGCM(key)
        ciphertext=aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext, associated_data)
        tag=ciphertext[-16:]
        actual_ciphertext=ciphertext[:-16]
        return {"ciphertext": actual_ciphertext, "tag": tag}

Add imports.

Also we may want to set logging? Not needed.

Return type Any.

Ok.

Wrap with sentinel lines.
