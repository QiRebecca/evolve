analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method faster than baseline. We can use networkx or other libraries. But we need to produce maximum common subgraph. This is NP-hard. Baseline uses CP-SAT. We can try to use heuristics? But must produce optimal solution. We can use ILP with pulp? But CP-SAT is efficient. Maybe we can use networkx's isomorphism? But we need maximum common subgraph, not isomorphism. Could use maximum common subgraph algorithm like VF2? But that's for isomorphism. For maximum common subgraph, we can use maximum common induced subgraph problem. Could use maximum common subgraph via maximum clique in product graph. Indeed, maximum common induced subgraph corresponds to maximum clique in the graph of pairs (i,p) where edges exist if adjacency matches. But we also need mapping one-to-one. The product graph: vertices are pairs (i,p). Edge between (i,p) and (j,q) if i!=j, p!=q, and A[i][j]==B[p][q]. Then maximum clique corresponds to maximum common subgraph. So we can compute maximum clique. Use networkx's algorithm for maximum clique? networkx.algorithms.clique.find_cliques returns all maximal cliques; we can find largest. For small graphs, it's fine. But we need to handle up to maybe 20 nodes? Not specified. But baseline uses CP-SAT, which can handle moderate sizes. We can implement maximum clique via branch and bound using networkx's algorithm or use python-igraph? But we only have networkx. networkx's find_cliques uses Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm with pivot. That is efficient for moderate graphs. So we can build product graph and find maximum clique. Complexity exponential but maybe fine for small graphs.

We need to output list of pairs (i,p). The mapping must be one-to-one. The clique ensures that. Also need to ensure that mapping is maximal. The maximum clique ensures maximum size. So we can implement.

Edge consistency: For each pair of selected nodes, adjacency must match. In product graph, edges exist only if adjacency matches. So clique ensures that.

We also need to ensure that mapping is one-to-one: In product graph, vertices are pairs (i,p). Two vertices share same i or same p cannot be in clique because we don't add edges between them? Wait we need to ensure that mapping is one-to-one: we cannot map two G nodes to same H node or vice versa. In product graph, we can add edges between vertices that share same i or same p? Actually we need to forbid them. In clique, all vertices must be pairwise adjacent. If we don't add edges between vertices that share same i or same p, then they cannot both be in clique because they are not adjacent. So we need to ensure that product graph has edges only between pairs with distinct i and distinct p and adjacency matches. That ensures one-to-one. So we can build graph accordingly.

Implementation steps:

- Input problem dict with A and B adjacency lists.
- n = len(A), m = len(B)
- Build adjacency matrix for A and B as lists of lists of ints.
- Build product graph Gp: nodes are tuples (i,p). Use networkx.Graph()
- For each pair of nodes (i,p) and (j,q) with i<j, p<q? Actually we need to consider all pairs. Add edge if i!=j, p!=q, and A[i][j]==B[p][q].
- Then find maximum clique using networkx.algorithms.clique.find_cliques. Keep track of largest clique size and clique.
- Return list of pairs sorted maybe by i? Not required but baseline returns unsorted. We can return sorted by i for consistency.

Edge case: If no mapping, return empty list.

Complexities: For n,m up to maybe 20, product graph has n*m nodes, edges maybe many. find_cliques may be heavy but okay.

We need to import networkx. Use from typing import Any.

Implement solve method accordingly.

We also need to ensure that we don't exceed time limit. For bigger graphs, this may be slow. But baseline CP-SAT also may be slow. But we can try to optimize by using bitset representation and use networkx's algorithm. But we can also use python's built-in algorithm for maximum clique from networkx. That uses recursion and pivot. Might be okay.

We can also use networkx.algorithms.clique.max_clique? There's networkx.algorithms.clique.find_cliques. There's also networkx.algorithms.clique.max_clique? Actually networkx.algorithms.clique.max_clique returns a maximum clique. Let's check: networkx.algorithms.clique.max_clique(G) returns a maximum clique. That uses a heuristic? Let's check docs: networkx.algorithms.clique.max_clique(G) returns a maximum clique. It uses a branch and bound algorithm. So we can use that.

Thus:

from networkx.algorithms.clique import max_clique

clique = max_clique(Gp)

Return list of pairs.

Edge consistency: Already satisfied.

Let's implement.

Potential issues: networkx's max_clique may return a clique but not necessarily maximum? It should be maximum. We'll trust.

Let's produce solver.py accordingly.

We need to ensure we import networkx.

Also we need to handle case where A or B may be empty. Then return [].

Let's produce final code.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
