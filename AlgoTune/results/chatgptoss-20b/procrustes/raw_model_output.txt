analysisWe need to produce solver.py with class Solver and solve method. We can implement same logic but maybe optimize. Use numpy SVD. Could use np.linalg.svd with full_matrices=False. Use np.dot. Should be fine. Ensure return dict with key "solution" mapping to list of lists. Use .tolist().

Also need to import Any. Use typing.Any.

We should also handle potential errors? Not necessary.

We should keep same signature: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any.

Return dict.

We can also use np.linalg.svd(M, full_matrices=False). Then G = U @ Vt. That's fine.

We can also use np.linalg.svd(M, full_matrices=False) to reduce memory.

Also we can use np.dot for M = B @ A.T.

Return solution.

We need to ensure we import numpy as np.

Also we need to import logging? Not necessary.

But baseline uses logging. We can skip.

We just need to produce solver.py content.

Let's produce:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        A = problem.get("A")
        B = problem.get("B")
        if A is None or B is None:
            return {}
        A = np.array(A, dtype=float)
        B = np.array(B, dtype=float)
        if A.shape != B.shape:
            return {}
        M = B @ A.T
        U, _, Vt = np.linalg.svd(M, full_matrices=False)
        G = U @ Vt
        return {"solution": G.tolist()}

That's it.

Wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>

        if A is None or B is None:
            return {}
        A = np.array(A, dtype=float)
        B = np.array(B, dtype=float)
        if A.shape != B.shape:
            return {}
        M = B @ A.T
        U, _, Vt = np.linalg.svd(M, full_matrices=False)
        G = U @ Vt
        return {"solution": G.tolist()}
