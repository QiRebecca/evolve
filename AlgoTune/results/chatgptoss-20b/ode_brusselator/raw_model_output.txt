analysisWe need to write solver.py that solves Brusselator ODE quickly. Use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with method 'RK45' or 'DOP853'. For speed, maybe use a simple explicit method like RK4 with fixed step? But we need accuracy to 1e-5 relative. Using solve_ivp with dense output? We just need final state at t1. Use solve_ivp with t_eval=[t1] to get final. Use vectorized ODE. Provide fast.

We need to import numpy, scipy.integrate. Use solve_ivp with method='RK45', rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-10 maybe. That should be fine.

Also we need to handle problem dict. Implementation: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any: parse t0, t1, y0, params. Use solve_ivp. Return final state array.

Also need to import Any from typing.

Edge: ensure success. If not, raise RuntimeError.

Return numpy array shape (2,). The baseline returns sol.y[:, -1] which is shape (2,). So we return that.

We need to ensure we don't use too many imports. Use numpy as np, from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp.

Also we can set max_step maybe to reduce steps? But default adapt.

We can also use 'DOP853' for higher order.

Let's implement.

Also we need to ensure that the solver is fast. For large t1 maybe 200. ODE is simple. solve_ivp will be fine.

Implement:

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        t0 = problem['t0']; t1 = problem['t1']; y0 = np.array(problem['y0'], dtype=float); A=problem['params']['A']; B=problem['params']['B'];
        def f(t, y):
            X, Y = y
            dX = A + X**2 * Y - (B+1)*X
            dY = B*X - X**2 * Y
            return [dX, dY]
        sol = solve_ivp(f, (t0, t1), y0, method='DOP853', rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-10, t_eval=[t1])
        if not sol.success:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Solver failed: {sol.message}")
        return sol.y[:, -1]

Return numpy array.

Also we might want to convert to list? The baseline returns array. The is_solution expects solution to be list? Wait: In is_solution, they call self.solve(problem) to get ref_solution. Then they convert to np.array. So our solve returns array. Good.

Also the outer harness expects solve returns Any. So array fine.

Let's produce final code.

Also we need to include sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
