analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve using FFT convolution. We can use numpy. Use np.fft.fft, ifft. For real signals, we can use np.fft.fft. We need to handle modes: full, same, valid. We need to match output shape. Use np.fft.fftconvolve? But we can implement manually. But we can also use scipy.signal.fftconvolve if available. But we want to avoid heavy dependencies? We have scipy. So we can just call scipy.signal.fftconvolve. But baseline uses that. But we can implement faster? But baseline is already efficient. But we can maybe use numpy's FFT directly. But baseline uses scipy.signal.fftconvolve which uses numpy.fft. So maybe we can just call that. But we need to return list? The baseline returns dict with key "convolution" and value is numpy array. But is_solution expects list. It checks isinstance(student_result, list). So we must return list. So we need to convert to list. So solution = {"convolution": convolution_result.tolist()}. That matches baseline. But baseline returns numpy array? It returns solution = {"convolution": convolution_result}. But is_solution expects list. But baseline's solution is used for validation? The baseline's solve returns numpy array, but is_solution expects list. But maybe they convert? Wait baseline's solve returns dict with key "convolution" and value is numpy array. But is_solution expects list. But maybe they convert? In is_solution, they check if "convolution" in solution. Then student_result = solution["convolution"]. They check isinstance(student_result, list). So baseline would fail? But baseline is used for reference? Actually baseline is used for grading. But they might convert? But we need to match expected format. The baseline's solve returns numpy array, but is_solution expects list. That seems inconsistent. But maybe they convert to list before passing to is_solution? But not shown. But we should follow is_solution: return list. So we will return list.

We need to handle empty inputs: if either signal empty, result length 0. So we can check.

Implement solve:

- Convert signals to numpy arrays.
- If either empty: return {"convolution": []}
- Determine mode.
- Use np.fft.fft to compute convolution: length = len_x + len_y - 1 for full. For same and valid, we can compute full then slice accordingly.

Compute n = len_x + len_y - 1. Compute fft length = next power of two >= n? For speed, we can use np.fft.fft with length n. But we can use np.fft.fft(signal_x, n) etc. Then multiply, ifft, real part.

Implement:

n = len_x + len_y - 1
X = np.fft.fft(signal_x, n)
Y = np.fft.fft(signal_y, n)
Z = np.fft.ifft(X * Y).real

Then slice based on mode:

if mode == "full": result = Z
elif mode == "same": start = (n - max(len_x, len_y)) // 2; result = Z[start:start+max(len_x, len_y)]
elif mode == "valid": if len_x >= len_y: start = len_y - 1; result = Z[start:start+len_x - len_y + 1] else: start = len_x - 1; result = Z[start:start+len_y - len_x + 1]
But we need to match expected length: For valid, expected_len = max(0, max(len_x, len_y) - min(len_x, len_y) + 1). That equals abs(len_x - len_y) + 1? Actually if len_x >= len_y: len_x - len_y + 1. If len_y > len_x: len_y - len_x + 1. So we can compute.

But we need to handle case where len_x < len_y: then valid length = len_y - len_x + 1. But convolution full length n. For valid, we can compute start = len_y - 1 if len_x >= len_y else len_x - 1. Then result = Z[start:start+valid_len].

Edge cases: if len_x == 0 or len_y == 0: return [].

Also handle mode "same": expected_len = max(len_x, len_y). For same, we need to center. For even difference, start = (n - expected_len) // 2. For odd difference, same formula works.

Return list.

We need to import numpy as np. Also from typing import Any.

Implement class Solver with solve method.

Return dict with key "convolution" and value list.

We need to ensure we use np.fft.fft and ifft. Use real part.

Also handle dtype float.

Let's write code.

Also we need to handle mode string case-insensitive? Baseline uses mode = problem.get("mode", "full") and passes to fftconvolve. So we can assume mode is correct.

Implement.

Also we need to handle potential small floating errors: we can round to maybe 12 decimals? But not necessary.

Return list.

Let's produce final code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
