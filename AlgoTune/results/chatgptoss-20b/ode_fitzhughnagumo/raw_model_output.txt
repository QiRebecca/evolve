analysisWe need to produce solver.py that solves FitzHugh-Nagumo ODE quickly. Baseline uses some solver, maybe scipy.integrate.solve_ivp. We need to produce same output within tolerance. We can implement a simple explicit RK4 with fixed step size? But need to match final state exactly as baseline. Baseline likely uses solve_ivp with default method 'RK45' and default tolerances. We need to produce same final state. But we can compute using same method? We can call scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with same parameters. That would be straightforward and fast enough. But we need to ensure we match output exactly. The baseline's solve returns sol = self._solve(problem, debug=False). We don't know _solve implementation. But likely uses solve_ivp with default tolerances. So we can replicate that.

We need to implement solve that returns list of two floats final state. The input problem dict contains t0, t1, y0, params. We can call solve_ivp with t_span (t0, t1), y0, method='RK45', rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9 maybe. But baseline may use default rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9. We can use same. Then return sol.y[:, -1].tolist().

We need to import numpy and scipy.integrate. Use typing.Any.

Also need to handle potential failure: if sol.success False raise RuntimeError.

We need to ensure we import necessary modules.

Let's write solver.py accordingly.

We need to ensure we don't import heavy modules unnecessarily. But we can import numpy as np, scipy.integrate.

We need to define class Solver with solve method.

Also we need to ensure we don't use any other packages.

Let's produce code.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
