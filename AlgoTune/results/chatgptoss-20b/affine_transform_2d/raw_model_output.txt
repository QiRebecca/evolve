analysisWe need to implement a fast solver for 2D affine transform with cubic spline interpolation (order=3) and constant mode padding zeros. Baseline uses scipy.ndimage.affine_transform. We can use scipy's ndimage or maybe use skimage transform warp? But we want speed. For small images maybe overhead negligible. But we can implement using numpy and SciPy's map_coordinates? But that's similar.

We can attempt to use scipy.ndimage.affine_transform directly but maybe set order=3, mode='constant', cval=0.0. That is baseline. But we can maybe precompute inverse matrix? But affine_transform already does that.

Maybe we can use numba to accelerate? But implementing cubic spline interpolation manually is heavy.

Given constraints, simplest is to call scipy.ndimage.affine_transform. That matches baseline. But we need to ensure same parameters: order=self.order, mode=self.mode. In baseline, self.order and self.mode presumably defined elsewhere. We need to set them in our class. Let's set order=3, mode='constant', cval=0.0.

Also need to handle potential exceptions.

Thus implement:

class Solver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.order=3
        self.mode='constant'
        self.cval=0.0

    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs):
        image=problem['image']
        matrix=problem['matrix']
        try:
            transformed_image=scipy.ndimage.affine_transform(image, matrix, order=self.order, mode=self.mode, cval=self.cval)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(...)
            return {"transformed_image":[]}
        return {"transformed_image": transformed_image.tolist()}

But note: The solution expects array, not list? In baseline they return array. In is_solution, they convert proposed_list to array. They expect list? They check if proposed_list is list. So we should return list of lists. So convert to list.

Also need imports: numpy, scipy.ndimage, logging.

Return type Any.

Let's produce solver.py accordingly.

Ensure no extra text. Use sentinel lines.

Let's craft code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
