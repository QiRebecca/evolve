analysisWe need to implement a solver for Earth Mover's Distance (optimal transport). Baseline uses ot.lp.emd from POT library. We can use POT as well. But we might want to speed up by using linear programming solver like cvxpy or scipy.optimize. But baseline uses ot.lp.emd which is efficient. We can just call ot.lp.emd. But we need to import ot. The environment may have POT installed. The baseline uses ot.lp.emd. So we can just replicate that. But we might want to optimize by using numpy operations? But the baseline is already efficient. We can maybe use ot.emd2? But we need plan. So ot.lp.emd is fine.

We need to implement solve method that returns dict with "transport_plan" as numpy array. The baseline returns G as numpy array. The is_solution expects list of lists or numpy array. So we can return numpy array.

We need to import typing.Any. Also import numpy as np. And import ot. But we need to ensure ot is available. The environment includes POT? The baseline uses ot.lp.emd. So we can import ot.

We need to ensure M is contiguous float64. Use np.ascontiguousarray.

Also we can optionally normalize a and b to sum to 1. But baseline expects they sum to same value. We can trust input.

We can also add check_marginals=False.

Thus implement:

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        a = problem["source_weights"]
        b = problem["target_weights"]
        M = problem["cost_matrix"]
        M_cont = np.ascontiguousarray(M, dtype=np.float64)
        G = ot.lp.emd(a, b, M_cont, check_marginals=False)
        return {"transport_plan": G}

We need to import typing.Any, numpy, ot.

Also we might want to convert a,b to numpy arrays if they are lists. ot.lp.emd expects array-like. It can handle lists. But we can convert to np.asarray.

Thus:

a = np.asarray(problem["source_weights"], dtype=np.float64)
b = np.asarray(problem["target_weights"], dtype=np.float64)

Return G.

Also we might want to ensure G is float64.

Thus final code.

We need to output only solver.py content between sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
