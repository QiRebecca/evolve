analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method faster than baseline CP-SAT. We can use ILP or CP-SAT but maybe use heuristic or greedy? But must return optimal solution. We could use CP-SAT but with better modeling: use linear constraints for attack lines but we can precompute reach sets. But baseline already does that. We can speed up by using OR-Tools CP-SAT but maybe use a faster solver like OR-Tools CP-SAT with some heuristics? But baseline uses log_search_progress True, which slows. We can set parameters to speed: solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds maybe? But we need optimal solution. We can use CP-SAT with no log, maybe use search strategy. But we can also use a maximum bipartite matching approach? This is maximum independent set in a graph where vertices are free cells, edges between cells that attack each other. That's maximum independent set, NP-hard. But board size maybe small? But we need general.

We can use ILP with binary variables and constraints: For each pair of attacking cells, add constraint x_i + x_j <= 1. That's many constraints. But we can use CP-SAT with only constraints for each queen: sum of others in reach <= 1? Actually baseline uses only_enforce_if: if queen at (r,c) then sum of others in reach == 0. That's equivalent to x_i + sum_{j in reach} x_j <= 1. That is linear. We can use that.

We can also use a faster solver like OR-Tools CP-SAT with no log, maybe set parameters: solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 30? But we need optimal. We can use CP-SAT with search strategy: use variable with highest degree first. But baseline may be slow for large boards.

Alternatively, we can use a heuristic to find a good solution quickly, but we need optimal. Maybe we can use a branch and bound with pruning. But CP-SAT is good.

We can also use a maximum bipartite matching approach if board has no obstacles? But with obstacles, it's not bipartite.

Maybe we can use a maximum independent set solver using networkx's algorithm? But that is exponential.

Given constraints, maybe the baseline is fine but we can speed by removing print statements and log_search_progress. Also we can precompute reach sets once and reuse. Also we can use OR-Tools CP-SAT with linear constraints: for each pair of attacking cells, add x_i + x_j <= 1. That might be simpler and fewer constraints? Actually number of pairs equals number of edges in attack graph. For each queen, we add constraint that sum of others in reach <= 1. That's similar.

We can also use OR-Tools CP-SAT with "AddImplication" or "Add" constraints.

We can also use a faster solver like OR-Tools CP-SAT with "solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8" etc.

But the baseline uses only_enforce_if, which is efficient.

We can also use a custom solver: use a maximum bipartite matching on diagonals? Actually queens attack along rows, columns, diagonals. With obstacles blocking, the graph is not bipartite.

Maybe we can use a maximum independent set solver using branch and bound with bitsets. For board up to maybe 10x10? But unknown.

Given the time, we can implement a solver that uses OR-Tools CP-SAT but with some optimizations: no print, no log, set parameters to speed. Also we can precompute reach sets and store them in a list of lists.

Also we can use the "AddImplication" constraints: for each pair (i,j) that attack, add x_i + x_j <= 1. That is simpler.

Let's implement:

- Compute list of free cells: free_cells = [(r,c) for r in range(n) for c in range(m) if not instance[r,c]].
- Map each cell to index.
- For each cell, compute reach positions using queen_reach function (we need to implement queen_reach). The baseline uses queen_reach defined elsewhere. We need to implement it. We can implement queen_reach that yields all cells reachable from (r,c) until obstacle or board edge.

- Build adjacency list: for each cell, for each reachable cell, add edge (i,j). To avoid duplicate constraints, we can only add constraint for i<j.

- Then create binary variables x_i for each free cell.

- Add constraints: for each edge (i,j), add x_i + x_j <= 1.

- Maximize sum x_i.

- Solve with CP-SAT.

This might be faster because we avoid many only_enforce_if constraints.

Also we can set solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 30? But we need optimal. But we can set solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8.

Also we can set solver.parameters.cp_model_presolve = True.

Also we can set solver.parameters.linearization_level = 0.

Also we can set solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 60 maybe.

But we need to guarantee optimal. We can rely on CP-SAT to find optimal.

We also need to implement queen_reach. Let's implement:

def queen_reach(board, pos):
    r,c = pos
    n,m = board.shape
    directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1),(-1,-1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(1,1)]
    for dr,dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
        while 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not board[nr,nc]:
            yield (nr,nc)
            nr += dr
            nc += dc

We need to import numpy.

Also we need to import ortools.sat.python.cp_model.

We need to implement solve method.

Also we need to ensure we return list of tuples.

We also need to ensure we don't use print statements.

Also we need to ensure we don't use log_search_progress.

Also we need to ensure we don't use any heavy imports.

Let's write code.

Also we need to ensure we use typing.Any.

Also we need to ensure we don't use any global variables.

Also we need to ensure we don't use any heavy loops.

We can precompute adjacency list using set to avoid duplicates.

Implementation:

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        import numpy as np
        from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

        board = problem
        n,m = board.shape
        free_cells = [(r,c) for r in range(n) for c in range(m) if not board[r,c]]
        idx = {cell:i for i,cell in enumerate(free_cells)}
        num_cells = len(free_cells)
        model = cp_model.CpModel()
        x = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(num_cells)]

        # Build adjacency constraints
        # For each cell, compute reachable cells
        directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1),(-1,-1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(1,1)]
        for i,(r,c) in enumerate(free_cells):
            for dr,dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                while 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not board[nr,nc]:
                    j = idx[(nr,nc)]
                    if i < j:
                        model.Add(x[i] + x[j] <= 1)
                    nr += dr
                    nc += dc

        # Maximize sum
        model.Maximize(sum(x))

        solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
        solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8
        solver.parameters.cp_model_presolve = True
        solver.parameters.linearization_level = 0
        solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 60.0
        solver.parameters.log_search_progress = False

        status = solver.Solve(model)

        if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
            result = [(free_cells[i][0], free_cells[i][1]) for i in range(num_cells) if solver.Value(x[i]) == 1]
            return result
        else:
            return []

We need to import typing.Any.

Also we need to ensure we don't use any other functions.

We also need to ensure we don't use any global variable.

We also need to ensure we don't use any heavy loops.

This should be fine.

Let's produce final code.
