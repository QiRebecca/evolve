analysisWe need to produce solver.py with a Solver class that implements solve method. We can use numpy.linalg.eigh directly on generalized problem? The baseline uses Cholesky transform. We can use scipy.linalg.eigh? But only numpy available. We can use numpy.linalg.eigh with B? Actually numpy.linalg.eigh can solve generalized eigenvalue problem if we pass B? No, numpy.linalg.eigh only solves standard. But we can use scipy.linalg.eigh if available. But we only have numpy. We can use numpy.linalg.eigh after transforming. We can compute L = np.linalg.cholesky(B). Then compute Linv = np.linalg.inv(L). But computing inverse is expensive; we can solve linear system instead: Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.inv(L).T? Actually we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But easier: compute Linv = np.linalg.inv(L). For small n, fine. But we can optimize: use np.linalg.solve(L, A) to get Y = L^{-1} A. Then Atilde = Y @ L^{-T}. Because L^{-T} = (L.T)^{-1}. So compute Y = np.linalg.solve(L, A). Then Atilde = Y @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can also compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But we can compute Atilde = np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). This is repetitive. Let's just compute Linv = np.linalg.inv(L). It's fine.

We need to import numpy as np. Also from typing import Any. The solve method returns list[float] sorted descending.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0] to get eigenvalues. Then sort descending.

We can also use np.linalg.eigvals? But eigh is better.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde, UPLO='L')? But default.

We need to ensure we return list of floats.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0].tolist() and then sorted reverse.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0][::-1] if eigenvalues sorted ascending. eigh returns ascending. So we can just reverse.

Thus solution = np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0][::-1].tolist()

Return that.

We need to ensure we import numpy.

We can also use np.linalg.cholesky.

We need to handle potential errors? Not necessary.

We can also use np.linalg.solve to avoid inverse: compute Linv = np.linalg.inv(L). It's fine.

We can also use np.linalg.solve(L, A) @ np.linalg.solve(L.T, np.eye(n)). But simpler to compute Linv.

Thus code:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        A, B = problem
        L = np.linalg.cholesky(B)
        Linv = np.linalg.inv(L)
        Atilde = Linv @ A @ Linv.T
        eigs = np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0]
        return eigs[::-1].tolist()

We need to ensure we import numpy as np.

Also we need to handle if problem is tuple of numpy arrays. We can assume.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0] returns array.

Return list.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde, UPLO='L')[0] but not needed.

We can also use np.linalg.eigh(Atilde)[0][::-1].tolist()

Thus final code.

We need to wrap between sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
