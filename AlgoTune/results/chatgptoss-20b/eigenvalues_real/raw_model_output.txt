analysisWe need to produce solver.py with a Solver class that implements solve method. The baseline uses np.linalg.eigh to compute eigenvalues. We can just replicate that. But we can try to optimize: maybe use np.linalg.eigvalsh which is faster? np.linalg.eigh returns eigenvalues and eigenvectors; eigvalsh returns eigenvalues only. So we can use np.linalg.eigvalsh. That might be slightly faster. Also we can skip sorting by using np.sort with kind='mergesort' descending? But sorting n eigenvalues is trivial. Use np.sort(eigvals)[::-1]. That is efficient.

Also we need to import numpy as np. Use typing.Any. Provide solve method signature: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any: return list of floats sorted descending.

We need to ensure that the output is a list of floats. np.sort returns numpy array; we can convert to list via .tolist().

Also we need to ensure that the function is fast. Use np.linalg.eigvalsh.

Edge: problem is NDArray. We can import numpy as np. Use np.linalg.eigvalsh.

Return list of floats.

Also we need to include from typing import Any.

We need to output only the file content between sentinel lines.

Thus final output:

<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Compute eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix efficiently.
        """
        # Compute eigenvalues only using eigvalsh for speed.
        eigvals = np.linalg.eigvalsh(problem)
        # Sort in descending order.
        eigvals_desc = np.sort(eigvals)[::-1]
        return eigvals_desc.tolist()
<<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>
