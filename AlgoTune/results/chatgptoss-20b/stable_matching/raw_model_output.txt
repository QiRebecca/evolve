analysisWe need to produce solver.py with optimized Gale-Shapley. The baseline uses list pop(0) which is O(n). We can use deque for free list. Also use array of ints. Use local variables for speed. Use Python lists. Use while loop. Use next_prop array. Use recv_match list. Use recv_rank 2D list. Use for loops. Use .pop() from deque. Use .append. Use .popleft. That will be faster.

Also we can precompute proposer_prefs as list of lists. Use local variables for speed.

Also we can use memoryviews? Not needed.

We can also use numpy? But overhead.

Simplify: Use deque.

Also we can use while free: p = free.popleft().

Also we can use for r in proposer_prefs[p][next_prop[p]:] but we need to increment.

We can use while loop.

Also we can use local variables for recv_rank[r] etc.

Also we can use list comprehension for matching.

Also we can use .index? But we avoid .index in stability check; but we don't need to implement that.

We just need to produce same output.

We can also use array of ints for recv_match, initialize with -1.

Implementation:

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        prop_raw = problem["proposer_prefs"]
        recv_raw = problem["receiver_prefs"]

        if isinstance(prop_raw, dict):
            n = len(prop_raw)
            proposer_prefs = [prop_raw[i] for i in range(n)]
        else:
            proposer_prefs = list(prop_raw)
            n = len(proposer_prefs)

        if isinstance(recv_raw, dict):
            receiver_prefs = [recv_raw[i] for i in range(n)]
        else:
            receiver_prefs = list(recv_raw)

        recv_rank = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
        for r, prefs in enumerate(receiver_prefs):
            rank_list = recv_rank[r]
            for rank, p in enumerate(prefs):
                rank_list[p] = rank

        from collections import deque
        free = deque(range(n))
        next_prop = [0]*n
        recv_match = [-1]*n

        while free:
            p = free.popleft()
            prefs = proposer_prefs[p]
            r = prefs[next_prop[p]]
            next_prop[p] += 1
            cur = recv_match[r]
            if cur == -1:
                recv_match[r] = p
            else:
                rank_p = recv_rank[r][p]
                rank_cur = recv_rank[r][cur]
                if rank_p < rank_cur:
                    recv_match[r] = p
                    free.append(cur)
                else:
                    free.append(p)

        matching = [0]*n
        for r, p in enumerate(recv_match):
            matching[p] = r

        return {"matching": matching}

This should be fine.

We need to import Any.

Also we need to ensure we don't use any other imports except collections.

We can import collections inside function.

Return type Any.

Ok.

Let's produce final output.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
