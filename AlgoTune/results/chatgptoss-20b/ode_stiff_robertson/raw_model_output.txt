analysisWe need to write solver.py that solves Robertson stiff ODE quickly. Use diffrax? We can use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with method='BDF' or 'Radau', which handles stiff. For speed, we can use solve_ivp with dense_output? But we only need final state. Use solve_ivp with t_span (t0,t1), y0, method='BDF', rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9 maybe. That should be fast. But we need to match baseline output within tolerance 1e-5 relative, 1e-8 absolute. Use same tolerances as baseline? Baseline uses default? Not given. But we can set rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9 to be safe.

We need to import numpy as np. The input problem dict has keys t0, t1, y0, k. We need to compute final state.

Implement function _rhs(t, y, k). Use vectorized operations.

Return list of floats.

Edge: t1 may be large, but solve_ivp handles.

We need to ensure speed: use numpy operations, no loops.

Also we can use diffrax's solve with diffrax. But scipy is fine.

Let's implement.

Also we need to handle potential failure: if sol.success false raise RuntimeError.

Return list of floats.

Also we need to import Any.

Let's produce code.

Also we need to ensure we don't import heavy packages unnecessarily. Use only numpy and scipy.

Let's write.

Also we need to ensure we don't use logging.

Ok.

Let's produce final code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
