analysisWe need to produce solver.py content. We need to implement solve method that computes QR factorization. Baseline uses np.linalg.qr with mode='reduced'. We can just call that. But we can maybe optimize by using numpy's linalg.qr which is efficient. We can also use np.linalg.qr with mode='reduced' which returns Q shape (m, k) where k = min(m,n). For A shape (n, n+1), m=n, n=n+1, so k=n. So Q shape (n,n), R shape (n,n+1). That's fine.

We need to return dictionary with "QR": {"Q": Q.tolist(), "R": R.tolist()}. That matches baseline.

We need to import numpy as np, typing.Any. Also maybe we can use np.linalg.qr. That's fine.

We need to ensure we don't add extra prints. Just the code.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce:

<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Compute the QR factorization of the input matrix A using NumPy's
        linalg.qr function with mode='reduced'.
        """
        A = problem["matrix"]
        Q, R = np.linalg.qr(A, mode="reduced")
        return {"QR": {"Q": Q.tolist(), "R": R.tolist()}}
<<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>
