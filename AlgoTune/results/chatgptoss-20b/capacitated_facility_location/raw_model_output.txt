analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve faster than baseline. Baseline uses CVXPY with HIGHS. We can use pulp or ortools to solve ILP faster. Use pulp with CBC or gurob? Only open-source. Use pulp's default CBC. Or use ortools linear solver. Let's implement using ortools linear solver. That should be faster.

We need to produce same output: objective_value, facility_status list of bools, assignments matrix.

We need to ensure feasibility and optimality within 1% tolerance. Use integer variables. Use linear solver with integer variables. Use OR-Tools CP-SAT? Actually OR-Tools CP-SAT is good for integer programming. Use cp_model. That might be fastest.

Implement using ortools.sat.python.cp_model. We'll create model, add boolean variables y[i], x[i][j]. Add constraints: each customer sum x[i][j] == 1. For each facility: sum_j d_j * x[i][j] <= s_i * y[i]. Also x[i][j] <= y[i] (but that is redundant if we enforce capacity? but keep). Objective: minimize sum f_i * y_i + sum c_ij * x_ij.

Solve with cp_model. Use solver.Solve() with default parameters. Might need to set time limit? Not necessary.

Return solution. Use solver.Value for variables.

We need to import from typing import Any. Use numpy for arrays? Not necessary but for output we need assignments as list of lists of floats 0.0/1.0. Use int values.

Return objective_value as float.

Edge: if solver fails, return inf etc.

Implement.

Let's write code.

Also need to handle potential large problem sizes. CP-SAT can handle moderate sizes. But baseline uses CVXPY; we can use CP-SAT.

Implement:

from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        fixed_costs = problem["fixed_costs"]
        capacities = problem["capacities"]
        demands = problem["demands"]
        transportation_costs = problem["transportation_costs"]

        n_facilities = len(fixed_costs)
        n_customers = len(demands)

        model = cp_model.CpModel()

        y = [model.NewBoolVar(f'y_{i}') for i in range(n_facilities)]
        x = [[model.NewBoolVar(f'x_{i}_{j}') for j in range(n_customers)] for i in range(n_facilities)]

        # each customer served
        for j in range(n_customers):
            model.Add(sum(x[i][j] for i in range(n_facilities)) == 1)

        # capacity constraints
        for i in range(n_facilities):
            model.Add(sum(int(demands[j]) * x[i][j] for j in range(n_customers)) <= int(capacities[i]) * y[i])
            # x <= y
            for j in range(n_customers):
                model.Add(x[i][j] <= y[i])

        # objective
        obj_terms = []
        for i in range(n_facilities):
            obj_terms.append(int(fixed_costs[i]) * y[i])
            for j in range(n_customers):
                obj_terms.append(int(transportation_costs[i][j]) * x[i][j])
        model.Minimize(sum(obj_terms))

        solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
        solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = kwargs.get('time_limit', 60.0)
        status = solver.Solve(model)

        if status not in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE):
            return {"objective_value": float("inf"),
                    "facility_status": [False]*n_facilities,
                    "assignments": [[0.0]*n_customers for _ in range(n_facilities)]}

        facility_status = [bool(solver.Value(y[i])) for i in range(n_facilities)]
        assignments = [[float(solver.Value(x[i][j])) for j in range(n_customers)] for i in range(n_facilities)]
        objective_value = solver.ObjectiveValue()

        return {"objective_value": float(objective_value),
                "facility_status": facility_status,
                "assignments": assignments}

But we used int(demands[j]) etc. But demands may be floats. CP-SAT requires integer coefficients. We can scale by 1000? But demands and capacities may be floats. We can multiply all by 1000 and round to int. But that may change objective? We can keep as floats by using linear programming? CP-SAT only integer. But we can use linear solver with floats? Use ortools.linear_solver. That supports continuous variables but not integer. But we need binary. We can use linear solver with integer variables? The linear solver supports integer variables but not binary? It supports integer variables but not binary? Actually linear_solver supports integer variables but not binary? It supports integer variables but not binary? It supports integer variables but not binary? It supports integer variables but not binary? Wait, linear_solver supports integer variables but not binary? It supports integer variables but not binary? I think it supports integer variables but not binary. But we can use binary by setting lower=0, upper=1. That works.

But linear solver uses floating point, but we can set integer variables. But objective may be fractional. But we can use linear solver with integer variables and float coefficients. That should be fine.

Let's use linear_solver with CBC. That might be faster.

Implement:

solver = pywraplp.Solver.CreateSolver('CBC')
y = [solver.IntVar(0,1,f'y_{i}') for i in range(n_facilities)]
x = [[solver.IntVar(0,1,f'x_{i}_{j}') for j in range(n_customers)] for i in range(n_facilities)]

Constraints: same.

Objective: solver.Minimize(solver.Sum([...])).

Solve.

Return.

This uses integer variables but solver uses linear programming with integer constraints. Should be fine.

Let's implement using ortools.linear_solver.pywraplp.

Need to import from ortools.linear_solver import pywraplp.

Implement.

Edge: demands and capacities floats. Use them directly.

Return.

Let's produce final code.

Also need to import Any.

Let's produce final solver.py content.
