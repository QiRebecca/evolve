analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method computing N-dimensional FFT of complex array. Baseline uses scipy.fftpack.fftn. We can use numpy.fft.fftn which is faster? Actually numpy's FFT is efficient. We can also use numpy.fft.fftn. The baseline uses scipy.fftpack.fftn. We can use numpy.fft.fftn. That should produce same result. We need to import numpy as np. Use from typing import Any. The solve method should accept problem: NDArray. We can just return np.fft.fftn(problem). That should be fine. We need to ensure we import numpy. Also maybe use np.asarray to ensure array. But fine.

We need to output only the file content between sentinel lines. Ensure no extra whitespace. Provide code.

Let's produce:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Compute the N-dimensional FFT of a complex array."""
        return np.fft.fftn(problem)

That's it. Ensure no trailing spaces. Provide sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
