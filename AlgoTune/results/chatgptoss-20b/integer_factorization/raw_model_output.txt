analysisWe need to write a solver for integer factorization of product of two primes. Baseline uses sympy.factorint. We can use sympy's factorint but maybe slower. We can implement Pollard's Rho algorithm for speed. For 8*max(1,n) bits primes. n maybe up to? Not specified. Could be up to maybe 32 bits? But could be large. Pollard Rho is good for up to 64-bit? For bigger maybe 128-bit? But we can use sympy's factorint which uses Pollard Rho and other algorithms. But we can implement Pollard Rho ourselves for speed. Use random seeds. Use Miller-Rabin primality test for primality. Use Python's built-in pow with mod. Use random module. Use deterministic Miller-Rabin for 64-bit? But primes can be large maybe 256 bits. Use sympy.isprime? That uses Miller-Rabin with deterministic bases for 64-bit? For bigger uses probable prime. But we can rely on sympy.isprime for primality check. But we need factorization. Pollard Rho can factor large numbers quickly.

Implement Pollard Rho with Brent's cycle detection. Use random polynomial f(x) = x^2 + c mod n. Use gcd. Use random c. Use while loop until factor found.

Edge cases: composite may be small. Use simple trial division for small primes up to maybe 1000.

Implementation:

def _is_prime(n): use sympy.isprime.

def _pollard_rho(n): if n%2==0 return 2. if n%3==0 return 3. choose random c in [1,n-1]. Use f(x) = (x*x + c) % n. Use Brent's algorithm: y=2, r=1, q=1. While True: x=y; for i in range(r): y=f(y). Then k=0; while k<r: ys=y; for i in range(min(m, r-k)): y=f(y); q = q*abs(x-y) % n. k+=m. d=gcd(q,n). if d>1: if d==n: retry with new c. else return d. r*=2.

Set m=128.

Then factor recursively: def factor(n): if n==1 return []. if is_prime(n): return [n]. d=_pollard_rho(n). return factor(d)+factor(n//d).

Return sorted list.

We need to ensure we get exactly two primes. For product of two primes, factor will return [p,q] maybe unsorted. Sort.

Return dict.

We need to import random, math, sympy.

Also need typing.Any.

Implement solve method.

Edge: composite may be sympy.Integer or int. Convert to int.

We need to handle big ints.

Let's write code.

Also we can use sympy.isprime for primality test. That may be slower but fine.

We can also use sympy.ntheory.generate.random_prime? Not needed.

Implement.

Also we can use random.SystemRandom for better randomness.

Ok.

Let's produce solver.py content.
