analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements Base64 encoding but faster than baseline. Baseline uses base64.b64encode. We can implement custom fast base64 encode using built-in functions? But base64.b64encode is already efficient in C. But maybe we can use memoryview and precomputed table? But likely base64.b64encode is fine. But requirement: run faster than baseline. We can attempt to use numpy vectorization? But overhead may be more. Maybe we can use base64.b64encode but with bytes directly; it's already C-level. So maybe we can just call base64.b64encode. That would match baseline exactly. But we need to ensure we import base64. Also we need to handle errors.

But maybe we can use base64.b64encode but with memoryview to avoid copying? But base64.b64encode expects bytes-like object. It will copy anyway. But we can use base64.b64encode(plaintext) directly.

Alternatively, we can use base64.b64encode but with a custom mapping? But that's unnecessary.

Given constraints, simplest is to call base64.b64encode. That will be as fast as baseline. But baseline also uses base64.b64encode. So no improvement. But maybe we can use base64.b64encode but with a precompiled table? Not needed.

Maybe we can use base64.b64encode but with a small optimization: if plaintext length is multiple of 3, we can skip padding. But base64.b64encode handles that.

Thus we can just replicate baseline. But we need to ensure we import base64 and logging, hmac? Actually we don't need hmac. Just return encoded_data.

But we need to match signature: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any: Should return dict with encoded_data.

Also we need to import Any from typing.

Let's write:

from typing import Any
import base64
import logging

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        plaintext = problem.get("plaintext")
        if not isinstance(plaintext, (bytes, bytearray)):
            raise TypeError("plaintext must be bytes")
        try:
            encoded_data = base64.b64encode(plaintext)
            return {"encoded_data": encoded_data}
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error during Base64 encoding in solve: {e}")
            raise

That's it.

But maybe we can use base64.b64encode but with memoryview to avoid copying? But base64.b64encode will copy anyway. But we can use base64.b64encode(memoryview(plaintext)). That might be slightly faster? Let's test mentally: base64.b64encode accepts any buffer interface. Passing memoryview may avoid creating new bytes? But base64.b64encode will still create new bytes. But maybe memoryview reduces overhead of converting bytearray to bytes? But plaintext is bytes. So no difference.

Thus we can just use base64.b64encode.

But maybe we can use base64.b64encode but with a precompiled table? Not necessary.

Thus final solver.py content.

Wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
