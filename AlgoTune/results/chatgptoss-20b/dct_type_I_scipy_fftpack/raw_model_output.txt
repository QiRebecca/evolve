analysisWe need to implement a solver that computes DCT type I. Baseline uses scipy.fftpack.dctn. We can use scipy.fft.dctn? But we have scipy.fftpack available. We can also use numpy.fft? But DCT type I is not directly in numpy. We can use scipy.fftpack.dctn. But we want faster? Maybe use scipy.fft.dctn with type=1? SciPy's newer fft module may be faster. But we can also implement manually using FFT: DCT-I can be computed via FFT of even-symmetric extension. But easier: use scipy.fftpack.dctn. But maybe we can use scipy.fft.dctn which uses FFTW? Might be faster. Let's use scipy.fft.dctn. But we need to import scipy.fft. Let's check if available. The baseline uses scipy.fftpack. But we can use scipy.fft. It's part of SciPy. Should be available. So implement:

from scipy.fft import dctn

def solve(self, problem, **kwargs):
    return dctn(problem, type=1)

But we need to ensure same output as scipy.fftpack.dctn. They should match. Use dtype float64. Should be fine.

We can also add small optimization: use np.asarray to ensure array. But not necessary.

We need to import Any from typing.

Also we need to import numpy as np? Not needed.

But we need to import scipy.fft. So:

import scipy.fft

def solve(self, problem, **kwargs):
    return scipy.fft.dctn(problem, type=1)

But we need to ensure that the output shape matches. Should be same.

Alternatively, we can use scipy.fftpack.dctn directly. But baseline uses that. But we want faster. Use scipy.fft.dctn.

Let's implement.

Also we can add optional kwargs: maybe 'norm' or 'axis'? But not needed.

Return result.

We need to ensure that the function signature matches: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:

Ok.

Let's produce solver.py content.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
