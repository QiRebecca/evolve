analysisWe need to produce solver.py content implementing solve method faster than baseline. We can use cvxpy but maybe we can use direct analytic solution? But easier: use cvxpy but maybe use faster solver like ECOS_BB? But GP requires gp=True. Could use cvxpy with default solver (ECOS). Might be okay. But we can also use cvxpy with 'SCS' or 'ECOS' but gp=True uses ECOS. We can attempt to reduce overhead by precomputing constants and using vectorization? But constraints per condition independent except shared A,S. We could formulate as a GP with fewer variables: we can eliminate some variables via substitution? For example, we can express C_D in terms of other variables? But constraints involve inequalities; we might solve via cvxpy but maybe we can use a simpler solver like 'cvxpy' with 'ECOS' but still same.

Time limit: 10x baseline. Baseline uses cvxpy with many variables. We can speed up by using cvxpy's ability to handle vectorized constraints? We can create arrays of variables and constraints using list comprehensions. That may reduce overhead.

Also we can use 'cp.Variable' with shape (n,) for each variable type. Then constraints can be vectorized. That reduces Python loops.

Let's implement:

n = problem["num_conditions"]; conds = problem["conditions"]

Define A,S scalar.

Define V,W,Re,C_D,C_L,C_f,W_w as vectors of length n.

Constraints:

C_D >= CDA0/S + k*C_f*S_wetratio + C_L**2/(pi*A*e) elementwise.

But CDA0 etc vary per condition. We can create numpy arrays of these constants.

Similarly for others.

Implement using numpy arrays and broadcasting.

Then objective: sum(0.5*rho*V**2*C_D*S)/n.

Use cp.sum.

Return results.

Also we need to compute condition_results after solving.

We need to convert arrays to list of dicts.

Edge: need to ensure variable names for debugging? Not necessary.

Implementation details:

import cvxpy as cp, numpy as np

In solve, parse constants into numpy arrays:

CDA0_arr = np.array([c["CDA0"] for c in conds])
C_Lmax_arr = ...
N_ult_arr = ...
S_wetratio_arr = ...
V_min_arr = ...
W_0_arr = ...
W_W_coeff1_arr = ...
W_W_coeff2_arr = ...
e_arr = ...
k_arr = ...
mu_arr = ...
rho_arr = ...
tau_arr = ...

Now constraints:

constraints = []

# C_D >= CDA0/S + k*C_f*S_wetratio + C_L**2/(pi*A*e)
constraints.append(C_D >= CDA0_arr / S + k_arr * C_f * S_wetratio_arr + C_L**2 / (np.pi * A * e_arr))

# C_f >= 0.074 / Re**0.2
constraints.append(C_f >= 0.074 / cp.power(Re, 0.2))

# Re * mu >= rho * V * sqrt(S/A)
constraints.append(Re * mu_arr >= rho_arr * V * cp.sqrt(S / A))

# W_w >= W_W_coeff2 * S + W_W_coeff1 * N_ult * A**(3/2) * sqrt(W_0 * W) / tau
constraints.append(W_w >= W_W_coeff2_arr * S + W_W_coeff1_arr * N_ult_arr * cp.power(A, 1.5) * cp.sqrt(W_0_arr * W) / tau_arr)

# W >= W_0 + W_w
constraints.append(W >= W_0_arr + W_w)

# W <= 0.5 * rho * V**2 * C_L * S
constraints.append(W <= 0.5 * rho_arr * V**2 * C_L * S)

# 2*W/(rho*V_min**2*S) <= C_Lmax
constraints.append(2 * W / (rho_arr * V_min_arr**2 * S) <= C_Lmax_arr)

Objective: total_drag = 0.5 * cp.sum(rho_arr * V**2 * C_D * S) / n

Set problem = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(total_drag), constraints)

Solve with gp=True.

After solving, get values: A_val = A.value.item(); S_val = S.value.item()

Get arrays: V_val = V.value, etc.

Compute drag per condition: drag_val = 0.5 * rho_arr * V_val**2 * C_D_val * S_val

Return dict.

Need to import typing.Any.

Also need to handle solver errors.

Return same structure.

Should be faster due to vectorization.

Let's craft code accordingly.

Also we need to ensure we use cp.power for exponent.

Edge: cp.sqrt expects positive; constraints ensure positivity.

Ok.

Let's produce final solver.py content.
