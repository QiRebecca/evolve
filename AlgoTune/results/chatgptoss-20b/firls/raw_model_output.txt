analysisWe need to implement a solver that matches baseline but faster. Baseline uses scipy.signal.firls. We can implement our own FIRLS using numpy and maybe use scipy.signal.firwin? But we need least squares with piecewise constant desired. We can use scipy.signal.firls directly; but maybe we can precompute? But we need to be fast. The baseline uses signal.firls which is already efficient. But maybe we can use scipy.signal.firwin? But firwin is windowed design, not least squares. But we can approximate? But must match exactly. So we need to compute same coefficients. We can call scipy.signal.firls. That is fine. But we need to import signal from scipy. That is allowed. So just replicate baseline. But maybe we can speed up by caching? But each call is independent. But we can use numpy's vectorization. But baseline is fine. So implement same.

But we need to ensure we import scipy.signal. Use from scipy import signal. Use numpy as np. Use typing.Any. Provide solve method.

Also we need to handle edges may be list. So convert to tuple.

Return coeffs.

Thus solver.py content:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np
from scipy import signal

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        n, edges = problem
        n = 2 * n + 1
        edges = tuple(edges)
        coeffs = signal.firls(n, (0.0, *edges, 1.0), [1, 1, 0, 0])
        return coeffs

That's it.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
