analysisWe need to write a solver for LP box problem. Baseline uses CVXPY with CLARABEL. We can use other solvers like scipy.optimize.linprog or pulp. For speed, we can use scipy.optimize.linprog with method='highs' which is fast. The problem: minimize c^T x subject to A x <= b, 0 <= x <= 1. We can use bounds. Use linprog. Return solution vector. Ensure optimal. Use high precision? Use method='highs' default. Should be fine.

Implement solve: parse problem dict, convert to numpy arrays. Use linprog. Provide bounds list of (0,1). Use A_ub, b_ub. Then get result.x. Return list. Ensure status is optimal. If not, maybe fallback to something else. But baseline uses CLARABEL; we can use high. Should be fine.

Edge: if problem is infeasible? But baseline would error. We can just return solution anyway.

Implement.

Also import numpy as np, from scipy.optimize import linprog. Use dtype float.

Return {"solution": result.x.tolist()}

Add type hints.

Let's produce solver.py content.

Ensure we include from typing import Any.

Also include import statements.

Let's produce final output.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
