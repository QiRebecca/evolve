We need to implement Solver.solve faster than baseline. Baseline uses scikit-learn QuantileRegressor with solver="highs". We can use same but maybe faster? But we can also use linear programming via cvxpy or scipy? But baseline uses high speed interior point. We can replicate same but maybe use numpy? But quantile regression is linear programming. We can use cvxpy with ECOS or OSQP. But scikit-learn uses highs. We can use high speed solver from scipy? But we can just call scikit-learn as baseline. But requirement: faster within time limit. But baseline is already fast. But we can maybe use numpy to compute quantile regression via linear programming using cvxpy with ECOS. But that might be slower. But we can use scikit-learn's QuantileRegressor. That is fine. But we need to ensure we import necessary modules. We can also use sklearn's QuantileRegressor. But we need to import from sklearn. But baseline uses scikit-learn. We can just replicate baseline. But maybe we can use a faster approach: use linear programming via scipy.optimize.linprog. That might be faster for small data. But we don't know dataset size. But we can implement using scipy.optimize.linprog with method='highs' which is same as scikit-learn's solver. That might be faster because we avoid scikit-learn overhead. Let's implement using scipy.optimize.linprog.

Quantile regression: minimize sum_i (tau * max(y_i - X_i beta, 0) + (1-tau) * max(X_i beta - y_i, 0)). Equivalent to linear programming with variables: beta (p), u_i >=0, v_i >=0 such that y_i - X_i beta <= u_i, X_i beta - y_i <= v_i. Objective: minimize tau * sum u_i + (1-tau) * sum v_i. No intercept? If fit_intercept True, we add intercept term as additional coefficient. So we can augment X with column of ones.

We need to solve linear program: minimize c^T z where z = [beta, u, v]. Variables: p = n_features (+1 if intercept). u_i, v_i each n_samples. So total variables = p + 2n. Constraints: For each i: -X_i beta + u_i >= -y_i? Wait we need constraints: y_i - X_i beta <= u_i => -X_i beta + u_i >= -y_i? Actually we can express as: -X_i beta + u_i >= -y_i? Let's derive: y_i - X_i beta <= u_i => -X_i beta + u_i >= -y_i? Multiply both sides by -1: X_i beta - y_i >= -u_i. Not good. Let's set constraints in standard form: A_ub x <= b_ub. We can set:

1) X_i beta - y_i <= v_i
2) -X_i beta + y_i <= u_i

So we have two inequalities per sample. Variables: beta (p), u_i, v_i. So A_ub shape (2n, p+2n). For each i, row for constraint 1: X_i for beta, 0 for u, 1 for v_i. b_ub: y_i. For constraint 2: -X_i for beta, 1 for u_i, 0 for v. b_ub: -y_i? Wait: -X_i beta + y_i <= u_i => -X_i beta + 0*u + 0*v <= -y_i? Actually we need to bring u_i to left: -X_i beta - u_i <= -y_i. But we want u_i on right side. Let's set constraint: -X_i beta <= u_i - y_i => -X_i beta - u_i <= -y_i. So row: -X_i for beta, -1 for u_i, 0 for v. b_ub: -y_i.

Similarly for v: X_i beta <= v_i + y_i => X_i beta - v_i <= y_i. Row: X_i for beta, 0 for u, -1 for v. b_ub: y_i.

Thus A_ub: first n rows: X_i for beta, 0 for u, -1 for v. b_ub: y_i. Next n rows: -X_i for beta, -1 for u, 0 for v. b_ub: -y_i.

Objective: minimize tau * sum u_i + (1-tau) * sum v_i. So c: zeros for beta, tau for u, (1-tau) for v.

We also need bounds: beta free (no bounds). u_i >=0, v_i >=0. So bounds: beta: (None,None), u_i: (0,None), v_i: (0,None).

We can use scipy.optimize.linprog with method='highs' which is efficient.

After solving, we get beta. Intercept if fit_intercept True: we added column of ones. So intercept is beta[0], others shift accordingly. We need to return coef as 2D list shape (1, n_features). intercept as list length 1. predictions: X @ beta (excluding intercept). If intercept, predictions = X @ beta[1:] + beta[0].

Edge cases: if n_samples=0? Not likely.

We need to import numpy, scipy.optimize.linprog.

Return as lists.

Let's implement.

Also we need to handle potential failure of linprog: if status not optimal, maybe fallback to scikit-learn? But we can assume data small.

Implement solve method accordingly.

Also we need to import typing.Any.

Let's write code.

We need to ensure we use np.array for X, y.

Also we need to convert predictions to list.

Let's implement.

Also we need to handle case where fit_intercept False: we don't add column of ones.

Return dict.

Let's produce solver.py content.
