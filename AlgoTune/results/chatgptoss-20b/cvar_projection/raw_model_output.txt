analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve faster than baseline. Baseline uses CVXPY with sum_largest. We can solve analytically? Problem: minimize ||x - x0||^2 subject to CVaR constraint: sum_largest(Ax, k) <= alpha where alpha = kappa * k. This is convex quadratic objective with linear constraints? sum_largest is convex but not linear. But we can transform: CVaR constraint equivalent to existence of t such that sum(max(Ax - t, 0)) <= (1-beta)*kappa? Wait standard CVaR: CVaR_beta(L) = min_t (t + 1/(1-beta) * E[max(L - t, 0)]). For discrete scenarios: CVaR <= kappa means there exists t such that sum(max(Ax - t, 0)) <= (1-beta)*kappa. But we have sum_largest(Ax, k) <= alpha where alpha = kappa * k. Since k = (1-beta)*n_scenarios. sum_largest of k largest losses <= alpha. Equivalent to CVaR <= kappa? Let's check: For discrete with equal probability 1/n, CVaR_beta = (1/(1-beta)) * (1/n) * sum_{i=1}^k l_{(i)} where l_{(i)} are largest losses. So sum_{i=1}^k l_{(i)} <= (1-beta)*n*kappa? Wait: CVaR <= kappa => (1/(1-beta)) * (1/n) * sum_{i=1}^k l_{(i)} <= kappa => sum_{i=1}^k l_{(i)} <= (1-beta)*n*kappa. But k = (1-beta)*n. So RHS = k * kappa. So indeed sum_largest(Ax, k) <= kappa * k. So constraint matches.

Thus we can solve via convex optimization with linear constraints by introducing auxiliary variables for each scenario: loss_i = A_i x. Then we need sum of k largest losses <= alpha. This is equivalent to: there exists threshold t such that sum(max(loss_i - t, 0)) <= (1-beta)*kappa? Wait earlier derived. But we can use linear programming with additional variables: For each scenario i, introduce variable u_i >= 0 representing excess over t. Also variable t. Constraint: loss_i - t <= u_i, u_i >= 0. Then sum u_i <= (1-beta)*kappa. But we also need t free. This is linear. So we can solve with quadratic objective and linear constraints: minimize ||x - x0||^2 subject to A x - t <= u, u >= 0, sum u <= (1-beta)*kappa. This is convex QP with linear constraints. We can solve using cvxpy with OSQP or ECOS? But baseline uses sum_largest which may be slower. We can use cvxpy with variable t and u. That might be faster. But we can also solve analytically? Might be easier to use cvxpy.

But we can also use numpy to solve via projection onto convex set? Might be complex.

We can use cvxpy with OSQP solver which is fast for QP. Provide solver='OSQP'. That may be faster.

Also we can use cvxpy's quad_form? But we can use cp.sum_squares.

Implementation: x = cp.Variable(n_dims), t = cp.Variable(), u = cp.Variable(n_scenarios). constraints: A @ x - t <= u, u >= 0, cp.sum(u) <= (1-beta)*kappa. objective: cp.sum_squares(x - x0). Solve with OSQP.

Also we can set solver parameters: verbose=False, eps_abs=1e-8, eps_rel=1e-8.

Return x.value.

Edge: if OSQP not available? But cvxpy will fallback.

We need to import cvxpy as cp, numpy as np.

Also we need to handle case where k=0? If beta=1, k=0, constraint sum_largest with k=0 is 0 <= alpha? alpha=0? Actually k=0, sum_largest of 0 largest is 0. So constraint always satisfied. Our formulation: sum u <= (1-beta)*kappa = 0. But u >= 0, so u must be 0. Also A x - t <= 0. That forces t >= max(Ax). But t free. This is fine. But we can skip constraint if k==0: just return x0? Actually if beta=1, CVaR constraint is trivial? But we can keep.

Also we need to handle if solver fails: return empty list.

We also need to import Any.

Let's craft solver.py.

We need to include sentinel lines.

Let's produce final code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
