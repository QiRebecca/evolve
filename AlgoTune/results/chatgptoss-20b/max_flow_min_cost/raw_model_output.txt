analysisWe need to implement a fast solver for max flow min cost. We can use networkx's algorithm but maybe slower. We can implement min-cost max-flow using successive shortest augmenting path with potentials (Johnson). Use adjacency list, capacities, costs. Use Dijkstra with potentials. Complexity O(F * E log V). For small graphs fine. Use numpy arrays for speed? But we can implement straightforward.

We need to output flow matrix. Implementation: parse problem dict: capacity, cost, s, t. Build adjacency list: for each i,j with capacity>0, add edge. We'll maintain residual capacities and costs. We'll use arrays: edges list of dicts: to, rev, cap, cost. Build graph as list of lists.

Implement min_cost_max_flow(s,t). Use potentials h initialized 0. While True: run Dijkstra to find shortest path distances dist from s to all nodes using cost + h[u] - h[v] for edges with cap>0. If dist[t]==inf break. Update potentials: h[v] += dist[v] if dist[v]<inf. Then find bottleneck flow along path by backtracking using prevnode, prevedge. Augment flow, update residual capacities. Accumulate flow and cost. Continue.

Return flow matrix: we need flow on original edges. We can store original edges indices. We'll create a matrix flow[n][n] zero. When augmenting, we add flow to original edge. We need to know which edge corresponds to original. In graph, we add forward edge with cap=capacity[i][j], cost=cost[i][j], and reverse edge with cap=0, cost=-cost[i][j]. When augmenting, we add delta to forward edge's flow. We can store flow in a separate matrix: when we augment along edge e (forward), we add delta to flow_matrix[u][v]. But we need to know if e is forward. We can store a flag is_forward. In edges list, we can store original index (u,v). For reverse edges, we can set original index None.

Implementation details: graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]. For each i,j: if cap>0: add_edge(i,j,cap,cost). add_edge function: graph[u].append([v, cap, cost, rev_index]) but we need rev index. We'll store as dict: {'to':v,'rev':rev,'cap':cap,'cost':cost,'orig':(i,j)}. For reverse: {'to':u,'rev':rev,'cap':0,'cost':-cost,'orig':None}. rev indices: len(graph[v]) before adding reverse.

During augmentation: we traverse path using prevnode, prevedge index. For each step, e = graph[prevnode][prevedge]. We reduce e['cap'] by d, and increase reverse cap by d. If e['orig'] is not None: flow_matrix[orig[0]][orig[1]] += d.

Return flow_matrix.

Edge case: multiple edges? Not given.

We need to import typing.Any.

Return list of lists.

Let's code.

Also we need to handle potential large graphs but fine.

Let's produce solver.py content.
