analysisWe need to produce solver.py content. The baseline uses np.dot. We can optimize by using numpy's matmul or dot. For large matrices, maybe use np.matmul or np.dot. Could also use np.einsum. But baseline is fine. We can also use np.dot directly. We can also use np.matmul. But we need to return list of lists? The baseline returns C as numpy array. But is_solution expects solution to be list of lists. Wait baseline solve returns C (numpy array). But is_solution expects solution to be list of lists. But baseline solve returns numpy array; but is_solution will convert solution to np.array. So returning numpy array is fine. So we can just return np.dot(A,B). But we can also use np.matmul. But same.

We can also use np.dot(A,B). For speed, we can use np.matmul. But dot is fine.

We can also use np.dot(A,B). For large matrices, maybe use np.dot. It's fine.

We can also use np.dot(A,B). So implement solve accordingly.

We need to import numpy as np. Also from typing import Any.

We need to define class Solver with solve method.

We can also add optional kwargs but ignore.

We can also use np.dot.

We can also use np.matmul.

We can also use np.dot.

We can also use np.dot.

Ok.

We need to output only the file content between sentinel lines.

Let's produce:

<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Compute the matrix product C = A Â· B efficiently.
        """
        A = np.array(problem["A"])
        B = np.array(problem["B"])
        return np.dot(A, B)
<<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>
