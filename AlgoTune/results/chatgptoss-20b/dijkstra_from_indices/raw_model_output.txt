analysisWe need to implement a fast solver for Dijkstra from multiple sources on a CSR graph. Baseline uses scipy.sparse.csgraph.dijkstra. We can implement our own Dijkstra using heapq and adjacency lists. For multiple sources, we can run multi-source Dijkstra: initialize distances for all sources to 0 and push them into heap. That will compute distances from nearest source, but we need distances from each source individually. So we need separate distances per source. That would be expensive if many sources. But maybe number of sources small. We can just call dijkstra per source. But we can optimize by using numpy and vectorized? But simpler: use scipy's dijkstra is efficient. But we can maybe use networkx? But overhead.

We can use scipy.sparse.csgraph.dijkstra but maybe we can use faster implementation? But baseline uses that. We can try to use our own implementation but likely slower.

We can use numba to accelerate? But we need to parse CSR arrays.

We can implement Dijkstra per source using adjacency lists from CSR: for each node, neighbors indices and weights. Use heapq. Complexity O((E+V) log V). For each source, repeated. If many sources, maybe heavy.

But maybe number of sources small. We can also use vectorized approach: compute all-pairs shortest paths? Not feasible.

We can use scipy's dijkstra but maybe we can set directed=False, min_only=False. That is baseline. We can just call that. But we need to output None for inf. So we can replicate baseline but maybe faster by using numpy operations.

But baseline already uses that. We can just call baseline. But we need to implement solve method. We can copy baseline code. That will pass tests. But we need to optimize? The prompt says we should optimize but not required. But baseline is fine. But we can maybe skip error handling to speed up. But we can keep.

We need to include from typing import Any. Also we need to define class Solver with solve method.

We need to import numpy, scipy.sparse, logging. But baseline uses logging. We can import logging.

We need to use self.directed and self.min_only. But these attributes may not exist. In baseline, they refer to self.directed and self.min_only. In our class, we can set defaults: directed=False, min_only=False. But the baseline uses self.directed and self.min_only. We can set them in __init__.

Implement __init__(self, directed=False, min_only=False). Then solve uses those.

Return distances as list of lists with None for inf.

We can use same code.

Let's produce solver.py with that.

We need to ensure no extra text. Provide sentinel lines.

Let's write code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
