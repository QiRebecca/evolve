analysisWe need to produce solver.py content. We need to implement solve method that is faster than baseline but returns same output. Baseline uses numpy.linalg.eig with scaling. We can maybe use scipy.linalg.eig? But numpy.linalg.eig is fine. For speed, we can avoid scaling? But scaling may improve stability but not necessary. We can just call scipy.linalg.eig? But numpy.linalg.eig is fine. We can also use numpy.linalg.eigvals? But we need eigenvectors. Use scipy.linalg.eig? Might be similar speed. But we can also use numpy.linalg.eig directly. The baseline uses scaling to avoid overflow. We can skip scaling to save time. But risk of numerical issues? For random matrices, maybe fine. But we need to pass is_solution. It checks residual <= 1e-6. If we skip scaling, residual may be slightly larger? But likely still fine. But to be safe, we can keep scaling but maybe use faster operations. The scaling step is just computing norm and dividing. That's fine.

We can also use numpy.linalg.eig directly. The baseline uses la.eig from numpy.linalg. That's fine.

We can also use numpy.linalg.eigvals? No.

We can also use scipy.linalg.eig? Might be similar.

We can also use numpy.linalg.eig with B? Actually numpy.linalg.eig only solves standard eigenvalue problem. For generalized, we need scipy.linalg.eig. But baseline uses la.eig(A_scaled, B_scaled). That is numpy.linalg.eig? Wait numpy.linalg.eig only takes one matrix. But numpy.linalg.eig can take two matrices? Actually numpy.linalg.eig only takes one matrix. But numpy.linalg.eig(A, B) is not valid. But the baseline uses la.eig(A_scaled, B_scaled). That is numpy.linalg.eig? Let's check: numpy.linalg.eig only accepts one argument. But numpy.linalg.eig(A, B) is not valid. However, numpy.linalg.eig can accept two arguments? I think numpy.linalg.eig only accepts one. But maybe they imported la as numpy.linalg? In baseline, they used la.eig(A_scaled, B_scaled). That might be from scipy.linalg? Wait they didn't import la. But likely la refers to numpy.linalg. But numpy.linalg.eig doesn't accept B. But maybe they used numpy.linalg.eig? Actually numpy.linalg.eig only accepts one argument. But maybe they used numpy.linalg.eig? But the baseline code might be wrong? But maybe they used numpy.linalg.eig? But the baseline code uses la.eig(A_scaled, B_scaled). That is not valid. But maybe they used scipy.linalg.eig? But they didn't import scipy.linalg. But maybe la refers to scipy.linalg? But they didn't import. But maybe they used numpy.linalg.eig? But that would error. But maybe the baseline is pseudo-code. But we need to produce a working solution. We can use scipy.linalg.eig for generalized eigenvalue problem. So we need to import scipy.linalg as la. But we can also use numpy.linalg.eigvals? No.

We can use scipy.linalg.eig(A, B, left=False, right=True). That returns eigenvalues and right eigenvectors. That is fine.

We need to sort eigenvalues and eigenvectors accordingly.

We need to normalize eigenvectors to unit norm.

We need to return lists of complex numbers.

We need to ensure sorting by real descending then imag descending.

We need to ensure eigenvectors are unit norm within tolerance.

We need to ensure residual <= 1e-6. Using scipy.linalg.eig should produce accurate results.

We need to implement solve method accordingly.

We need to import numpy as np, scipy.linalg as la.

We need to use scaling: scale_B = np.sqrt(np.linalg.norm(B)). But we can skip scaling? But we can keep scaling.

We need to compute eigenvalues, eigenvectors = la.eig(A_scaled, B_scaled, left=False, right=True). That returns eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

We need to normalize each eigenvector: v = eigenvectors[:, i]; norm = np.linalg.norm(v); if norm > 1e-15: eigenvectors[:, i] = v / norm.

Then pair and sort.

Return lists.

We need to ensure we convert to Python lists.

We need to import typing.Any.

We need to define class Solver with solve method.

We need to include sentinel lines.

We need to ensure no extra whitespace or lines outside sentinel.

We need to ensure file ends with sentinel line.

We need to ensure no trailing spaces.

We need to ensure we don't include any other code.

We need to ensure we import necessary modules.

We need to ensure we use numpy and scipy.linalg.

We need to ensure we use np.sqrt(np.linalg.norm(B)). But np.linalg.norm returns Frobenius norm by default. That's fine.

We need to ensure we use la.eig.

We need to ensure we handle complex numbers.

We need to ensure we convert eigenvectors to list of complex numbers.

We need to ensure we return tuple of lists.

We need to ensure we use **kwargs but ignore.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy libraries.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy loops.

We can vectorize normalization: compute norms of columns: norms = np.linalg.norm(eigenvectors, axis=0); then divide: eigenvectors = eigenvectors / norms.

But careful: if any norm is zero, we skip dividing. But we can handle with np.where.

Simpler: for i in range(n): v = eigenvectors[:, i]; norm = np.linalg.norm(v); if norm > 1e-15: eigenvectors[:, i] = v / norm.

That's fine.

Sorting: pairs = list(zip(eigenvalues, eigenvectors.T)). But eigenvectors is shape (n, n). eigenvectors[:, i] is column. So we can do eigenvectors.T to get shape (n, n) rows.

Then sort.

Return.

We need to ensure we convert to Python lists: eigenvalues_list = [complex(val) for val in sorted_eigenvalues]; eigenvectors_list = [list(vec) for vec in sorted_eigenvectors].

But eigenvectors are numpy arrays of complex. list(vec) will produce list of complex numbers.

We need to ensure we convert to complex type: complex(val) ensures complex.

But val may already be complex.

We can just do eigenvalues_list = [val for val in sorted_eigenvalues].

But to be safe, convert to complex.

We need to ensure we import typing.Any.

We need to ensure we import numpy as np, scipy.linalg as la.

We need to ensure we don't import other modules.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy loops.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy memory.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy loops.

Ok.

Let's write code.

We need to include sentinel lines.

We need to ensure no extra whitespace.

We need to ensure we don't include any comments? Comments are fine.

We need to return tuple[list[complex], list[list[complex]]].

We need to use **kwargs.

Ok.

Let's produce final code.
