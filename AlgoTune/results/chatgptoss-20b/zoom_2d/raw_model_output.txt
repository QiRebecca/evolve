analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method. We can use scipy.ndimage.zoom but maybe faster? We can use skimage.transform.resize? But we have scipy. The baseline uses scipy.ndimage.zoom. We can implement same but maybe use numpy and scipy? But we can just call scipy.ndimage.zoom. But we need to import scipy.ndimage. The baseline uses self.order and self.mode. We need to set those attributes. In baseline, order and mode likely defined in __init__? Not shown. We can set default order=3, mode='constant'. So implement class Solver with __init__ setting order=3, mode='constant'. solve uses scipy.ndimage.zoom. Should handle errors. Return dict. Should be fast. Use numpy array conversion? Input image is list of lists. We can convert to np.array. Use dtype=float. Then zoom. Return list of lists? The baseline returns array. But is_solution expects list? It converts proposed_list to np.asarray. So we can return array or list. But to be safe, return list of lists. But converting array to list may be slower. But okay. We can return array; is_solution will convert to np.asarray. It expects solution["zoomed_image"] to be list? It checks isinstance(proposed_list, list). So we must return list. So convert array to list of lists. Use .tolist().

Implement solve: image = problem["image"]; zoom_factor = problem["zoom_factor"]; convert image to np.array; try zoom; catch; return {"zoomed_image": []}. else return {"zoomed_image": zoomed_image.tolist()}. Ensure imports.

Also need to import logging? Not necessary. But baseline uses logging. We can ignore.

Implement.

Edge: if zoom_factor <=0? But not needed.

Return.

Let's produce code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
