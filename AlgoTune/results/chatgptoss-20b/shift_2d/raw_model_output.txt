analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method. We can use scipy.ndimage.shift but maybe faster? We can use numpy's interpolation? But baseline uses scipy.ndimage.shift. We can replicate same output but maybe faster by using scipy.ndimage.shift directly. But we can also use skimage.transform.warp? But we need same output. Use scipy.ndimage.shift is fine. But we can also use numpy's interpolation via scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates? But shift is simpler.

We need to import scipy.ndimage. Use order=3, mode='constant', cval=0.0. The baseline uses self.order and self.mode. We need to set these attributes in __init__ or default. Provide order=3, mode='constant'.

Also need to handle potential errors. But we can just call shift. The is_solution will compare to baseline. So we must produce same output. Use same parameters.

Thus implement:

class Solver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.order = 3
        self.mode = 'constant'
        self.cval = 0.0

    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        import numpy as np
        import scipy.ndimage
        image = problem["image"]
        shift_vector = problem["shift"]
        try:
            shifted_image = scipy.ndimage.shift(
                image, shift_vector, order=self.order, mode=self.mode, cval=self.cval
            )
        except Exception as e:
            # fallback: return empty list
            return {"shifted_image": []}
        return {"shifted_image": shifted_image}

But we need to ensure that the output is a list? The is_solution expects solution["shifted_image"] to be a list or array convertible to numpy array. It will convert to np.array. So we can return numpy array. That's fine.

Also we need to import Any from typing.

We need to ensure that the code is minimal.

Also we need to ensure that we don't import heavy modules unnecessarily. But we can import inside solve.

Also we need to ensure that we don't use logging. Not required.

Thus final code:

from typing import Any

class Solver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.order = 3
        self.mode = 'constant'
        self.cval = 0.0

    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        import numpy as np
        import scipy.ndimage
        image = problem["image"]
        shift_vector = problem["shift"]
        try:
            shifted_image = scipy.ndimage.shift(
                image, shift_vector, order=self.order, mode=self.mode, cval=self.cval
            )
        except Exception:
            return {"shifted_image": []}
        return {"shifted_image": shifted_image}

But we need to ensure that the output is a list? The is_solution will convert to np.array. So it's fine.

Edge: If image is list of lists, scipy.ndimage.shift expects array-like. It will convert to array. Good.

Thus final output.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
