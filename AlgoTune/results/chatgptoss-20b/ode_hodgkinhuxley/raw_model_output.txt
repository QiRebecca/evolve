analysisWe need to write solver.py that solves Hodgkin-Huxley ODE to final time t1, returning final state. Baseline uses some solver, maybe solve_ivp. We need to produce same output within tolerance. We can implement a custom solver using explicit RK4 with small step size? But need to match baseline output exactly? The baseline uses some solver, maybe solve_ivp with default method 'RK45'. Our solver must produce same final state within tolerance 1e-5 relative. We can use solve_ivp with same method. But we need to ensure same tolerance? The baseline's _solve likely uses solve_ivp with default tolerances. We can replicate that. But we don't have _solve. We can just call solve_ivp with same parameters. That should produce same result. But we need to ensure we use same tolerances as baseline. The baseline likely uses default rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-6? Not sure. But we can set rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-9 to be safe. But we need to match within 1e-5 relative. So we can use high precision.

We need to implement solve method that returns final state list. Use numpy. Use solve_ivp from scipy.integrate. Provide ODE function. Use t_span [t0, t1], y0. Use method='RK45', rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-10. That should produce accurate result. But we need to ensure gating variables remain in [0,1] but solver may produce slight out-of-range due to numeric errors. But tolerance small.

We need to import numpy as np, from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp. Use typing Any.

Implement class Solver with solve method.

Return final state as list of floats.

We need to ensure we don't use any other packages beyond allowed. SciPy is allowed.

Let's implement.

Edge: The problem dict may have keys t0, t1, y0, params. We need to parse.

Define function alpha_m(V) etc.

Implement ODE function f(t, y). Use local variables.

Return dy/dt.

Then call solve_ivp.

Check sol.success. If not, raise RuntimeError.

Return sol.y[:, -1].tolist().

We need to import typing.Any.

Also need to import numpy as np.

Return type Any.

Ok.

Let's produce code.

We need to wrap between sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
