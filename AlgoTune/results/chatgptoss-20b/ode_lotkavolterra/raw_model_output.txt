analysisWe need to produce solver.py with a Solver class that solves Lotka-Volterra ODE from t0 to t1, given initial y0 and params. Must be fast. Use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with method 'RK45' or 'DOP853' maybe. But we need to match baseline output exactly. Baseline uses self._solve(problem, debug=False). We don't know baseline implementation. But we can produce accurate solution. Use solve_ivp with dense output? We just need final state. Use high accuracy tolerance to match reference. Use rtol=1e-9, atol=1e-12 maybe. But we need to match baseline within 1e-5 relative tolerance. So we can use default tolerances maybe fine. But to be safe, use rtol=1e-9, atol=1e-12.

We need to ensure positivity. solve_ivp may produce negative due to numerical errors. We can clip to zero? But baseline may produce positive. We can enforce non-negative by using event or by using 'RK45' with 'vectorized' maybe. But we can just compute and then clip negative to zero? But that might change final values. But if negative values are tiny, clipping may not affect within tolerance. But better to use 'RK45' with 'max_step' small? But we can use 'DOP853' which is high order.

We need to produce final state as list of floats.

Implementation:

```
from typing import Any
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        t0 = problem["t0"]
        t1 = problem["t1"]
        y0 = np.array(problem["y0"], dtype=float)
        params = problem["params"]
        alpha = params["alpha"]
        beta = params["beta"]
        delta = params["delta"]
        gamma = params["gamma"]

        def lotka(t, y):
            x, y_pred = y
            dx = alpha * x - beta * x * y_pred
            dy = delta * x * y_pred - gamma * y_pred
            return [dx, dy]

        sol = solve_ivp(
            lotka,
            (t0, t1),
            y0,
            method="DOP853",
            rtol=1e-9,
            atol=1e-12,
            vectorized=False,
        )
        if not sol.success:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Solver failed: {sol.message}")
        final = sol.y[:, -1]
        # Ensure non-negative
        final = np.maximum(final, 0.0)
        return final.tolist()
```

But we need to import numpy. Also we need to ensure we don't use any other packages. It's fine.

We need to ensure that the solver returns same as baseline. Baseline may use solve_ivp with default tolerances. But we use stricter tolerances, should produce same within tolerance.

Edge: t1 may be large, but DOP853 can handle.

We need to ensure we don't exceed time limit. DOP853 is fast.

Return type: list[float].

We need to include from typing import Any.

Also we need to import numpy as np.

Also we need to import solve_ivp.

We need to ensure we don't use any other packages.

Let's produce final code.

Check for potential issues: The problem dict may have keys as strings. We use problem["t0"], etc. Good.

Return final as list of floats.

We need to ensure we don't use any other modules.

Ok.

Now produce output with sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
