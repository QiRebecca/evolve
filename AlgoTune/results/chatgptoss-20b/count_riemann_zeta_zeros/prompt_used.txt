You’re an autonomous programmer tasked with solving a specific problem.
You are to use the commands defined below to accomplish this task.
Apart from the default Python packages, you have access to the following
additional packages:
- cryptography
- cvxpy
- cython
- dask
- diffrax
- ecos
- faiss-cpu
- hdbscan
- highspy
- jax
- networkx
- numba
- numpy
- ortools
- pandas
- pot
- pulp
- pyomo
- python-sat
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- sympy
- torch
YOUR TASK:
Your objective is to define a class named ‘Solver‘ in ‘solver.py‘ with a
method:
‘‘’
class Solver:
def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
"""Your implementation goes here."""
...
‘‘’
IMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards
your function’s runtime.

This ‘solve‘ function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation
harness. Strive to align your class and method implementation as
closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.
For each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the baseline
runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as
fast as possible, while returning the same output as the baseline function (for the same given input). Be creative and optimize your
approach!

**GOALS:**
Your primary objective is to optimize the ‘solve‘ function to run as as
fast as possible, while returning the optimal solution.

You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you
will be penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning nonoptimal solutions.
Below you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read
it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver
should do.

Count Riemann Zeta Zeros task

Given a positive real number t, the task is to count the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function in
the critical strip `0 < real(z) < 1` with imag(z) <= t. The output should be an integer giving
the total number of zeros in the aforementioned region. It is OK to use arbitrary precision
or extended precision arithmetic for intermediate calculations.

Input: A dictionary with keys:
  - "t": A double precision floating point number giving the max imaginary part in the strip
         where zeros are to be counted.

Example input:
{"t": 2228.0}

Output: A dictionary with keys:
  - "result": An integer giving the number of zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the
              critical strip `0 < real(z) < 1` with imag(z) <= t.

Example Output:
{"result": 1729}

Category: misc

Here is the baseline which you will be graded against. Your task is to
write a function that produces the same output, in less time.

def solve(self, problem: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Count zeta zeros along critical strip with imaginary part <= t.

        Using `mpmath.mp.nzeros`.
        """
        result = mp.nzeros(problem["t"])
        return {"result": result}

This function will be used to check if your solution is valid for a given
problem. If it returns False, it means the solution is invalid:

def is_solution(self, problem: dict[str, Any], solution: dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Verify solution by comparing to reference."""
        expected_solution = self.solve(problem)["result"]
        observed_solution = solution["result"]
        return expected_solution == observed_solution


-----------

for <task.xxx> please extract from the file directly

--------

the only output we need is solver.py, please let the model output this only in exact form mentioned in the prompt, and the solver should be putted in solver.py under output path with corresponding task name.
-----
ABSOLUTE OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):

You MUST wrap the **entire and only** contents of solver.py between the
following two sentinel lines, with no extra characters, spaces or text
before/after them:

<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
<solver.py contents ONLY — no backticks, no explanations>
<<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>

Rules:
- Do NOT use Markdown code fences (no ```).
- Do NOT print anything outside <<<SOLVER_PY_START>>> … <<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>.
- The code must contain:
    - `from typing import Any`
    - `class Solver:` with `def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:`

CRITICAL:
- The file must END with the exact sentinel line <<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>.
- Never print anything after <<<SOLVER_PY_END>>>.
- Do not include explanations, logs, or markdown fences anywhere.
