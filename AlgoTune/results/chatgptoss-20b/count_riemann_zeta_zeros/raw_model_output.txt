analysisWe need to implement a fast solver for counting Riemann zeta zeros up to t. Baseline uses mpmath.mp.nzeros. We can use known formula: N(t) = (t/(2π)) * log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + O(1/t). But we need exact integer count. We can use Riemann–von Mangoldt formula with explicit error bound. For t up to maybe moderate size? Input example t=2228.0 gives result 1729. We can compute using mpmath's nzeros but we want faster. We can use mpmath's zeta zeros? But maybe we can use sympy's nroots? Not.

Better: Use known function: N(t) = floor( (t/(2π)) * log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + 1/(48π t) + ... ). But we need exact count. For t up to maybe 1e6? We can use the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula with error bound less than 1, so floor gives correct integer. According to literature, the error term is O(log t). But for t>2, the error is less than 1? Actually the error term is bounded by 1/(8π t) + ...? Let's check: The Riemann–von Mangoldt formula: N(t) = (t/(2π)) log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + S(t) + O(1/t). Where S(t) is the argument of zeta. But S(t) is bounded by O(log t). So we can't ignore. But we can compute S(t) using Riemann-Siegel formula? That's heavy.

But maybe the baseline uses mp.nzeros which uses mpmath's algorithm to count zeros exactly. We can replicate by using mpmath's nzeros but maybe we can speed up by using mp.nzeros with mp.dps set to something? But baseline uses default mp.dps maybe 15? That might be slow for large t. We can use mp.nzeros with mp.dps=50? Not.

Alternatively, we can use known formula for number of zeros up to t: N(t) = floor( (t/(2π)) * log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + 1/(48π t) - 1/(48π t)?? Actually there is explicit formula: N(t) = floor( (t/(2π)) * log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + 1/(48π t) - 1/(48π t)?? Let's search memory: The Riemann–von Mangoldt formula: N(t) = (t/(2π)) log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + O(log t). But the error term is less than 1 for t>2? I think the error is less than 1 for t>2. Actually the error term is bounded by 1/(8π t) + ...? Wait.

Let's approximate: For t=2228, compute formula: t/(2π)=2228/(6.283185)=354.7. log(t/(2π))=log(354.7)=5.87. So first term: 354.7*5.87=2082. 2082-354.7=1727.3. +7/8=1728.125. So floor gives 1728. But expected 1729. So we need more accurate. Add 1/(48π t) ~ 1/(48*3.1416*2228)=1/(335,000)=0.000003. negligible. So floor gives 1728 but expected 1729. So error >1? Actually difference 1. So we need to compute S(t) term. S(t) is the argument of zeta. For t=2228, S(t) maybe around 0.5? That would shift.

Thus we need to compute S(t). We can compute S(t) using mpmath's zeta argument? mpmath has function mp.zeta? We can compute S(t) = (1/π) * arg(ζ(1/2 + i t)). But computing arg of zeta at many points? We just need at t. We can compute using mpmath's zeta function with high precision. But computing arg may be expensive but still faster than nzeros? Maybe.

Alternatively, we can use mpmath's nzeros but with mp.dps=50? But baseline uses mp.nzeros which uses algorithm to find zeros. That might be slower.

But maybe we can use mpmath's nzeros but with mp.dps=50? But we can also use mpmath's nzeros with mp.dps=50 but maybe still slow.

Better: Use mpmath's nzeros but with mp.dps=50? Not.

We can implement our own algorithm: Use Riemann–von Mangoldt formula with S(t) computed via mpmath's zeta argument. Implementation: compute zeta(0.5 + i t) using mp.zeta, then compute its argument via mp.arg. Then compute S(t) = (1/π) * arg(zeta). Then N(t) = floor( (t/(2π)) * log(t/(2π)) - t/(2π) + 7/8 + S(t) ). That should give correct integer.

Let's test with t=2228. Compute using python? Let's approximate: arg(zeta(0.5+ i 2228)). Hard to approximate manually. But we can trust that formula yields correct integer.

We need to ensure mp.dps high enough to compute arg accurately. Use mp.dps=50 maybe.

Implementation: import mpmath as mp. In solve, set mp.dps = 50. Compute t = problem["t"]. Compute t2 = t/(2*mp.pi). Compute N0 = t2*mp.log(t2) - t2 + mp.mpf(7)/8. Compute z = mp.zeta(mp.mpf(1)/2 + mp.mpf(1j)*t). Compute S = mp.arg(z)/mp.pi. Then N = mp.floor(N0 + S). Convert to int. Return {"result": int(N)}.

We need to import mpmath. Use from mpmath import mp. Ensure mp.dps set.

Time: computing zeta at one point with high precision may be okay.

Edge cases: t small? For t<2 maybe formula not accurate. But baseline uses mp.nzeros which counts zeros up to t. For small t, we can fallback to mp.nzeros. But we can also compute directly: For t<2, zeros count is 0? Actually first zero at t≈14.13. So for t<14.13, result 0. So we can handle t<14.13: return 0.

But baseline uses mp.nzeros which will compute correctly. So we can implement: if t < 14.13: return 0.

But we need to ensure for t between 0 and 14.13, result 0. For t=14.13, result 1. So we can compute using formula for t>14.13.

Let's implement.

Also we need to import typing.Any.

Return dict.

Let's produce solver.py accordingly.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
