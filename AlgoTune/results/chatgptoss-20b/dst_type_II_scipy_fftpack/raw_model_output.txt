analysisWe need to implement a solver that computes DST Type II of a 2D array. Baseline uses scipy.fftpack.dstn. We can use scipy.fftpack or scipy.fft. But we can also use numpy.fft? DST is not in numpy. But we can use scipy.fftpack.dstn. But maybe we can use scipy.fft.dstn? SciPy 1.10+ has scipy.fft. But we can just import scipy.fftpack. That is fine.

We need to optimize runtime. For 2D DST, we can use scipy.fftpack.dstn which is efficient. But maybe we can use scipy.fft.dstn which uses FFTW? But both are similar. We can also use scipy.fftpack.dst with axis. But dstn is fine.

We can also use numpy's FFT to compute DST via sine transform formula: DST type II can be computed via FFT of extended array. But using scipy.fftpack is fine.

We need to implement solve method that returns NDArray. We need to import numpy as np, scipy.fftpack. Use type=2. The baseline uses that. We can just call same. But we need to be faster. Maybe we can use scipy.fft.dstn which uses FFTW and is faster. Let's use scipy.fft.dstn. But we need to import from scipy.fft import dstn. That might be faster. Let's use that.

Also we can use numba? But overhead. Let's just use scipy.fft.dstn.

Implementation:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np
from scipy.fft import dstn

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        return dstn(problem, type=2)

But we need to ensure that problem is NDArray. We can cast to np.array. But not necessary.

We need to ensure that the output dtype matches. dstn returns float64.

We need to import numpy? Not required but fine.

Let's produce solver.py content accordingly.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
