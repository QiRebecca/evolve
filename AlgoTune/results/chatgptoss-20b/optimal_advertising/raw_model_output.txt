analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method faster than baseline. We can use cvxpy but maybe use a more efficient solver or use linear programming with piecewise linear? The objective is sum_i min(R_i * sum_t P_it * D_it, B_i). This is concave but can be linearized by introducing auxiliary variables for clicks per ad: let x_i = sum_t P_it * D_it. Then revenue per ad = min(R_i * x_i, B_i). That's concave but can be represented as linear constraints with auxiliary variable y_i <= R_i * x_i and y_i <= B_i, maximize sum y_i. Also D >=0, sum_i D_it <= T_t, sum_t D_it >= c_i. Also x_i = sum_t P_it * D_it. So we have linear constraints and linear objective. So we can solve as linear programming. Use pulp or cvxpy with GLPK or CBC. Use pulp for speed. Let's implement using pulp. We'll need to import pulp. It's available? Not listed but pulp is in baseline. We can use pulp. Or use cvxpy with solver=ECOS_BB? But linear programming is fine.

Implement solve: parse problem, create pulp.LpProblem maximize. Variables D_i_t continuous >=0. Variables x_i >=0. Variables y_i >=0. Constraints: sum_t D_i_t >= c_i. sum_i D_i_t <= T_t. x_i == sum_t P_it * D_i_t. y_i <= R_i * x_i. y_i <= B_i. Objective maximize sum y_i.

After solving, get D values, compute clicks, revenue, etc. Return dict.

Need to ensure pulp is installed. It's part of baseline? Not listed but likely available. Alternatively use cvxpy with solver=ECOS_BB? But linear programming with cvxpy is fine. But we can use cvxpy with solver=ECOS_BB? Actually ECOS_BB is for mixed integer. For LP, use ECOS or OSQP. But pulp may be faster.

Let's implement with pulp. Use pulp.LpVariable.dicts. Use LpProblem. Use LpMaximize. Use LpContinuous. Use LpVariable('D_{i}_{t}', lowBound=0). Use LpVariable('x_{i}', lowBound=0). Use LpVariable('y_{i}', lowBound=0). Add constraints.

After solving, get status. If status not optimal, return status. else compute.

Return dict with keys: status, optimal, displays, clicks, revenue_per_ad, total_revenue, objective_value.

Need to convert to list of lists.

Also need to import numpy for calculations.

Let's write code.

Edge: pulp status mapping: pulp.LpStatus[prob.status] gives string. Use prob.status.

Check optimal: prob.status == pulp.LpStatusOptimal.

Return.

Let's produce solver.py content.
