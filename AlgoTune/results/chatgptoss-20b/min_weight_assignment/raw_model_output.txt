analysisWe need to implement a solver for minimum weight assignment problem. Baseline uses scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching. We can use same function. But we can optimize by using numpy arrays directly? But baseline is already efficient. We can maybe use networkx or linear_sum_assignment from scipy.optimize. But we need to handle sparse matrix. We can convert to dense? That might be heavy for large n. But baseline uses csgraph which handles sparse. So we can just replicate baseline but maybe avoid try/except overhead? But we need to handle errors. We can just implement same logic but maybe use numpy for conversion? But baseline uses csr_matrix. We can use scipy.sparse.csr_matrix. That is fine.

We can also use the function directly: row_ind, col_ind = scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching(mat). That is fine.

We need to import typing.Any. Also need to import numpy as np, scipy.sparse. We can also import logging? Not necessary. But baseline uses logging. We can skip logging.

We need to return dict with assignment row_ind and col_ind as lists.

We can also use the function from scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment but that expects dense matrix. But we can convert to dense if n small. But unknown.

Better to use csgraph.

We can also use the function from scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching. That returns row_ind, col_ind as numpy arrays.

We can implement solve as:

def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
    data = problem["data"]; indices = problem["indices"]; indptr = problem["indptr"]; shape = problem["shape"]
    mat = scipy.sparse.csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), shape=shape)
    row_ind, col_ind = scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching(mat)
    return {"assignment": {"row_ind": row_ind.tolist(), "col_ind": col_ind.tolist()}}

We can also handle errors: if any exception, return empty lists.

We can also use numpy to convert to list.

We need to import typing.Any.

We need to ensure we don't use logging. But we can import logging if we want.

We need to ensure we don't use any other packages.

We can also use the function from scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching. That is fine.

We need to ensure we pass matrix positionally, not keyword. So we call min_weight_full_bipartite_matching(mat). Good.

We need to ensure we return correct type.

We can also use the same is_solution function to test.

We can also add type hints.

We can also use numpy as np.

We can also use from typing import Any.

We can also import scipy.sparse.

We can also import numpy as np.

We can also import logging if we want.

But we can skip logging.

We need to ensure we don't import any heavy packages unnecessarily.

We can also use the same baseline but maybe skip try/except to reduce overhead. But we need to handle potential errors. But we can assume input is correct.

But we can keep try/except for safety.

We can also use the function from scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching.

We can also use the function from scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment but that expects dense matrix. But we can convert to dense if n small. But we don't know n.

Better to use csgraph.

Thus final code:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np
import scipy.sparse

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        try:
            mat = scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(
                (problem["data"], problem["indices"], problem["indptr"]),
                shape=problem["shape"]
            )
        except Exception:
            return {"assignment": {"row_ind": [], "col_ind": []}}
        try:
            row_ind, col_ind = scipy.sparse.csgraph.min_weight_full_bipartite_matching(mat)
        except Exception:
            return {"assignment": {"row_ind": [], "col_ind": []}}
        return {"assignment": {"row_ind": row_ind.tolist(), "col_ind": col_ind.tolist()}}

We can also import numpy as np but not used. But we can keep.

We can also import logging but not used.

We can also use np.isclose but not needed.

Thus final code.

We need to wrap between sentinel lines.
