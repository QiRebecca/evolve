analysisWe need to produce solver.py with a Solver class that implements solve method. We can just use numpy.linalg.svd as baseline. But we can try to optimize: maybe use np.linalg.svd with full_matrices=False. That's fine. But we can also use np.linalg.svd with compute_uv=True. It's same. For speed, we can use np.linalg.svd. For large matrices, maybe use scipy.linalg.svd? But numpy is fine.

We need to import numpy as np. Also from typing import Any. The solve method should accept problem dict with keys "n", "m", "matrix". We can ignore n,m. We need to return dict with keys "U","S","V" as numpy arrays? The baseline returns numpy arrays. The is_solution expects lists? It converts solution["U"] to np.array. So we can return numpy arrays. That is fine.

We need to ensure we don't use any heavy overhead. Just compute.

We can also use np.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False). That returns U, s, Vh. Then V = Vh.T. Return dict.

We need to ensure we import numpy. Also we can use np.asarray to convert input matrix to array.

We need to ensure we don't convert to list. Just return numpy arrays.

We need to ensure we don't use any other packages.

Thus solver.py content:

from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        A = np.asarray(problem["matrix"])
        U, s, Vh = np.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False)
        V = Vh.T
        return {"U": U, "S": s, "V": V}

That's it.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Thus final output.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
