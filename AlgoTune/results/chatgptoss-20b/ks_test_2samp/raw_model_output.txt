analysisWe need to implement a fast KS test. The baseline uses scipy.stats.ks_2samp. We can implement our own efficient algorithm: sort both samples, compute empirical CDF differences. Complexity O(n log n). For pvalue, we need to compute p-value for two-sample KS statistic. For large n, approximate formula: pvalue = Q_{KS}([sqrt(n1*n2/(n1+n2)) + 0.12 + 0.11/sqrt(n1*n2/(n1+n2))] * D). But we need accurate to sqrt(eps). We can use scipy.stats.kstwo.sf? But we cannot import stats? We can import scipy.stats. But baseline uses stats.ks_2samp. We can replicate that but maybe faster? But we can use scipy.stats.kstwo.sf directly. But we need to compute D. Let's implement D as max absolute difference of ECDFs. We can compute using two-pointer merge. Then compute pvalue using scipy.stats.kstwo.sf(D * sqrt(n1*n2/(n1+n2)), n1+n2). Wait kstwo.sf takes statistic and df? Actually kstwo.sf(x, df) where df = n1+n2? Let's check: In scipy.stats, kstwo.sf(x, df) returns survival function of Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution with df degrees of freedom? Actually kstwo is the distribution of KS statistic for two-sample test with df = n1+n2? Let's check quickly: In scipy.stats, kstwo.sf(x, df) where df is n1+n2? I think yes. But we can also use stats.ks_2samp which uses method auto. But we can implement our own to avoid overhead. But maybe using scipy.stats.ks_2samp is fine. But we need faster. But baseline uses that. We can try to use numpy only. For pvalue, we can use the asymptotic formula: pvalue = 2 * sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k-1} exp(-2 k^2 lambda^2). But we can use scipy.stats.kstwo.sf. Let's just use that.

Implementation: compute D. Then lambda = D * sqrt(n1*n2/(n1+n2)). Then pvalue = scipy.stats.kstwo.sf(lambda, n1+n2). But we need to import scipy.stats. That is allowed. Let's implement.

Edge cases: if n1==0 or n2==0? Not given.

We need to ensure relative error sqrt(eps). Using scipy's function should be fine.

Let's implement solve accordingly.

We need to import numpy as np, scipy.stats as stats.

Compute D: sort both arrays. Use two pointers i,j. Keep cdf1 = i/n1, cdf2 = j/n2. At each step, compute diff = abs(cdf1 - cdf2). Keep max. Then increment pointer of smaller value. At end, after one array exhausted, we need to consider remaining values: when one array finished, cdf of that array stays at 1, other increases. But we can just loop until i==n1 and j==n2. After loop, we can compute final diff at end: abs(1-1)=0. So fine.

Let's code.

Also we need to handle case where sample1 and sample2 are lists. Convert to np.array.

Return dict.

Let's produce solver.py content.
