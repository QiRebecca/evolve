analysisWe need to produce solver.py content. The baseline uses np.linalg.solve. We can just replicate that. But we can optimize maybe by using numpy's linalg.solve directly. The baseline already does that. We can maybe use np.linalg.solve but ensure we convert to numpy array. We can also use np.linalg.solve with dtype float. But baseline is fine. We can also use np.linalg.solve with np.asarray. But no need.

We need to import numpy as np. Also from typing import Any. The solve method signature: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any. We need to return list[float]. So we can just implement same as baseline.

We need to ensure we don't import any heavy packages. Just numpy.

We need to output the file content between sentinel lines.

Thus:

<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
from typing import Any
import numpy as np

class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Solve the linear system Ax = b using NumPy's optimized solver.

        Args:
            problem (dict): A dictionary with keys "A" and "b".

        Returns:
            list: A list of numbers representing the solution vector x.
        """
        A = np.array(problem["A"])
        b = np.array(problem["b"])
        x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
        return x.tolist()
