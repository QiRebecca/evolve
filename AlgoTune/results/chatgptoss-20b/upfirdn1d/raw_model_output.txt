analysisWe need to implement a fast upfirdn1d. We can use numpy convolution with up/down. The baseline uses scipy.signal.upfirdn. We can implement manually: upsample by inserting zeros between samples: up factor. Equivalent to convolve with h after upsampling. But we can compute directly: result length = floor((len(x)*up + len(h)-1)/down). We can compute using np.convolve of upsampled x with h, then downsample. But upsampled x length = len(x)*up. Convolution cost O(N*M). For large arrays, maybe use FFT? But baseline likely small. We can implement efficient using np.pad and np.convolve. Use np.convolve which is efficient in C. Then slice.

Implementation: def upfirdn(h, x, up, down): upsampled = np.zeros(len(x)*up, dtype=complex?) but we can use np.zeros and assign: upsampled[::up] = x. Then conv = np.convolve(upsampled, h). Then downsample: conv[::down]. Return as array.

Edge: dtype: use same dtype as x or h. Use np.result_type. Use np.asarray.

Implement solve: iterate over problem list, each tuple (h,x,up,down). Compute using our function. Return list.

We need to import numpy as np. Also typing.Any.

Let's write solver.py accordingly. Ensure no extra prints. Use sentinel lines.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
