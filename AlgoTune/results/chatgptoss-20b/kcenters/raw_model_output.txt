analysisWe need to produce solver.py that implements solve method for k-center problem. We can use a simpler approach: compute all-pairs shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall or Dijkstra from each node. Then use binary search on radius and check feasibility via hitting set or covering problem: choose <=k centers such that all nodes within radius. This is NP-hard but we can use greedy or use integer programming? But we need optimal solution. We can use brute force for small graphs? But unknown size. We need efficient algorithm. The baseline uses SAT solver to find optimal. We can replicate but maybe simpler: use networkx to compute all-pairs shortest path lengths. Then use binary search on sorted unique distances. For each radius, we need to check if there exists a set of <=k centers covering all nodes within radius. This is a set cover problem but we can solve via integer programming using pulp or ortools. But we need optimal solution. We can use ILP: binary variable x_v for each node as center. Constraint: for each node u, sum_{v: dist(u,v)<=radius} x_v >= 1. Minimize sum x_v <= k. That's a feasibility check. Use pulp or ortools. Use pulp's CBC solver. That should be fine.

We need to return list of centers. We can solve ILP for each radius until minimal radius found. Then we can get solution from ILP. Complexity: number of nodes n, edges m. All-pairs shortest path O(n*m log n). ILP with n variables and n constraints. For each radius, we solve ILP. Binary search over sorted distances: O(log n^2). Acceptable.

Implement solve method: parse problem tuple (G_dict, k). Build graph using networkx or just use adjacency dict. Compute all-pairs shortest path distances using Dijkstra from each node. Use networkx's all_pairs_dijkstra_path_length. Then gather all unique distances. Sort. Binary search.

Feasibility check: use pulp.LpProblem with binary variables. Add constraints. Solve with default solver. If feasible, record solution. Continue binary search.

Return list of node names of selected centers.

Edge cases: k=0: return empty list if graph empty else error? But is_solution expects <=k. For k=0, only empty solution valid. We'll return empty list.

If graph empty: return empty list.

Implement.

Need to import pulp. It's available.

Return list of centers.

Let's code.

Also need to import typing.Any.

Implement class Solver with solve method.

Let's produce final code.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
