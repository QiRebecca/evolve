We need to implement Solver.solve that uses scipy.linalg.solve_toeplitz. But we can also implement custom algorithm? But baseline uses solve_toeplitz. We can just call that. But maybe we can speed up by using numpy arrays and maybe use np.linalg.solve? But Toeplitz structure can be exploited. But baseline uses solve_toeplitz which is efficient. We can just call that. But we need to import solve_toeplitz and matmul_toeplitz? The baseline uses solve_toeplitz from scipy.linalg. We can import that. Also we need to import numpy as np. The solve method returns list of floats. Should we convert to list? Yes.

We need to ensure we import solve_toeplitz. Also we might want to use np.asarray for speed. But it's fine.

We need to include from typing import Any. Also we need to import numpy as np. And from scipy.linalg import solve_toeplitz, matmul_toeplitz? Actually matmul_toeplitz is used in validator, not needed here. But we can import solve_toeplitz.

We need to define class Solver with solve method. The method signature: def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any. We can ignore kwargs.

We need to ensure we return list of floats. Use .tolist().

We need to handle potential errors? Not necessary.

We need to ensure we import solve_toeplitz. Let's write code.

Also we might want to use np.array with dtype float. But it's fine.

We need to ensure we don't import heavy modules unnecessarily. But it's fine.

Let's produce code.

We need to output only file contents between sentinel lines. No extra text.

Let's produce final.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
