Let's produce code that uses scipy.linalg.expm. That will produce same output. It's baseline but maybe we can add small optimization: convert list to numpy array, compute expm, return list of lists. That's fine.

We need to import numpy as np, from scipy.linalg import expm. Use typing.Any.

Let's produce solver.py accordingly.

We need to wrap with sentinel lines.

Let's produce final answer.assistantfinal<<<SOLVER_PY_START>>>
