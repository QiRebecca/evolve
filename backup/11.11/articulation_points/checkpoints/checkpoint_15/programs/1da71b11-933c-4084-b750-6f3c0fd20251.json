Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.\nFor each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the baseline runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the baseline function (for the same given input). OpenEvolve may track multiple metrics (e.g., speed, accuracy, robustness); improvements to any target metric are valid provided correctness is preserved.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - READ CAREFULLY:\nYou will receive the current Solver code and must respond with an IMPROVED complete version.\n\nYour response MUST follow this exact format:\n1. Brief analysis of optimization opportunities (1-3 sentences)\n2.
