For larger problems we use `scipy.signal.fftconvolve` on a flipped\n        second kernel (correlation == convolution with reversed kernel).\n        This turns the O(N\u00b7M) direct algorithm into an O(K log K) FFT\n        algorithm, giving large speed-ups for the big inputs that dominate\n        the benchmark.\n\n    The switch-over point is chosen via a simple heuristic that compares the\n    estimated operation counts of the direct method versus FFT.  This keeps\n    small-n cases snappy while greatly accelerating large-n cases, all while\n    guaranteeing bit-for-bit compatibility (up to numerical precision) with\n    the original reference.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Constant parameters of the task\n        self.mode = \"full\"\n        self.boundary = \"fill\"\n        # Heuristic threshold (in multiply\u2013adds) below which the direct C\n        # implementation is typically faster than FFT.
