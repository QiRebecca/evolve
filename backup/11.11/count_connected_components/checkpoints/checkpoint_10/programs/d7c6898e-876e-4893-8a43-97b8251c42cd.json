Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.\nFor each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the baseline runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the baseline function (for the same given input). OpenEvolve may track multiple metrics (e.g., speed, accuracy, robustness); improvements to any target metric are valid provided correctness is preserved.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - READ CAREFULLY:\nYou will receive the current Solver code and must respond with an IMPROVED complete version.\n\nYour response MUST follow this exact format:\n1. Brief analysis of optimization opportunities (1-3 sentences)\n2.

Define the hot `find`/`union` functions inside `solve` to keep them local (slightly faster attribute lookup).  \n3. Early-exit once all vertices belong to one component.  \n4. Avoid per-edge attribute look-ups and support any hashable edge container (tuple / list).\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple, Iterable\n\n\nSolutionType = Dict[str, int]\n\n\nclass Solver:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count connected components in an undirected graph faster than the\n    NetworkX baseline by using an efficient Union\u2013Find structure with\n    path-halving compression and union-by-size heuristics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def solve(self, problem: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs) -> SolutionType:  # noqa: D401\n        try:\n            n = int(problem.get(\"num_nodes\", 0))\n            # Accept any iterable of 2-item containers as edge list\n            edges: Iterable[Tuple[int, int]] = problem.get(\"edges\", ())\n\n            # Trivial cases\n            if n <= 0:\n                return {\"number_connected_components\": 0}\n            if not edges:\n                return {\"number_connected_components\": n}\n\n            # -----------------------------------------------------------------\n            # Fast disjoint-set (parent array stores negative size for roots)\n            # -----------------------------------------------------------------\n            parent: List[int] = [-1] * n  # negative \u21d2 root; -size\n\n            def find(x: int) -> int:\n                \"\"\"Path-halving find.\"\"\"\n                # Iterative path halving (almost as good as full compression,\n                # but with less overhead in Python loops).\n                while parent[x] >= 0:\n                    px = parent[x]\n                    if parent[px] >= 0:\n                        parent[x] = parent[px]\n                    x = px\n                return x\n\n            def union(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n                \"\"\"Union by size.
