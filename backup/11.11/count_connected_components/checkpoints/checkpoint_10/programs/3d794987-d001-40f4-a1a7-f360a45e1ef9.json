Your goal is to maximize SPEEDUP while maintaining 100% correctness.\n\nKEY METRIC: Speedup = Baseline Time / Your Time\n- 1.0x = same speed (no improvement)\n- 1.5x = 50% faster (good!)\n- 2.0x = 2x faster (excellent!)\n- < 1.0x = slower (bad!)\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- Maintain 100% correctness (num_errors must be 0)\n- Focus on SPEEDUP as your primary objective\n- Faster is better, but only if all tests pass\n\nEvery message you send incurs a cost--you will be informed of your usage and remaining budget.\nApart from the default Python packages, you have access to the following additional packages:\n\ncryptography\n\ncvxpy\n\ncython\n\ndask\n\ndiffrax\n\necos\n\nfaiss-cpu\n\nhdbscan\n\nhighspy\n\njax\n\nnetworkx\n\nnumba\n\nnumpy\n\nortools\n\npandas\n\npot\n\npulp\n\npyomo\n\npython-sat\n\nscikit-learn\n\nscipy\n\nsympy\n\ntorch\n\nYOUR TASK:\nYour objective is to define a class named 'Solver' in 'solver.py' with a method:\n\"\"\"\nclass Solver:\n    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"Your implementation goes here.\"\"\"\n        ...\n\"\"\"\nIMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards your function's runtime.\nThis 'solve' function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation harness. Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.\nFor each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the baseline runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the baseline function (for the same given input). OpenEvolve may track multiple metrics (e.g., speed, accuracy, robustness); improvements to any target metric are valid provided correctness is preserved.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - READ CAREFULLY:\nYou will receive the current Solver code and must respond with an IMPROVED complete version.\n\nYour response MUST follow this exact format:\n1. Brief analysis of optimization opportunities (1-3 sentences)\n2. Complete Python code in a ```python code block\n\nExample response format:\nThe current implementation has redundant validation checks. I'll streamline the encryption path and use memoryview to reduce allocations.\n\n```python\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM\n\nclass Solver:\n    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs):\n        # Your complete optimized implementation here\n        pass\n```\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- Always output the COMPLETE Solver class code, not partial edits\n- Code must be in a ```python block (starting with ```python on its own line)\n- Do NOT use command syntax (edit, eval, ls, etc.)\n- Do NOT output diffs or SEARCH/REPLACE blocks\n- The code must be runnable as-is\n\nOPTIMIZATION TIPS:\n- You have 8 CPU cores available for parallelization\n- Avoid if __name__ == \"main\" blocks (only solve() will be executed)\n- Compilation time of __init__() doesn't count towards runtime\n- After evaluation, you'll receive performance metrics vs baseline\n- Focus on speed while maintaining correctness\n\nGOALS:\nYour PRIMARY objective is to MAXIMIZE SPEEDUP (make your solver faster than baseline).\n- You succeed when speedup > 1.0x (faster than baseline)\n- You fail if speedup < 1.0x (slower than baseline) OR if any test fails\n- Higher speedup = better performance = higher score\n\nAfter each evaluation, focus on the speedup metric to guide your optimizations.\n\nBelow you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver should do.\n\nCount Connected Components\n\nCompute the number of connected components in an undirected graph. The graph is represented as a list of edges.\n The graph is generated using the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model with a fixed edge creation probability of 0.2,\n  ensuring the possibility of multiple disconnected components.\n\nInput:\nA dictionary representing the undirected graph:\n    - \"edges\": A list of tuples (u, v), where u and v are node indices representing an undirected edge between u and v.\n    - \"num_nodes\": An integer representing the total number of nodes in the graph.\n\nExample input:\n{\n    \"edges\": [(0, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4)],\n    \"num_nodes\": 5\n }\n\nOutput:\nA dictionary with key:\n    - \"number_connected_components\": An integer representing the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nExample output:\n{\n    \"number_connected_components\": 2\n}\n\nCategory: graph\n\n\nHere is the baseline which you will be graded against.
