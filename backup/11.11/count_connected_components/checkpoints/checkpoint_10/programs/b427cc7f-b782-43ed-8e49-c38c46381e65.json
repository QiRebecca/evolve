Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.\nFor each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the baseline runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the baseline function (for the same given input). OpenEvolve may track multiple metrics (e.g., speed, accuracy, robustness); improvements to any target metric are valid provided correctness is preserved.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - READ CAREFULLY:\nYou will receive the current Solver code and must respond with an IMPROVED complete version.\n\nYour response MUST follow this exact format:\n1. Brief analysis of optimization opportunities (1-3 sentences)\n2. Complete Python code in a ```python code block\n\nExample response format:\nThe current implementation has redundant validation checks. I'll streamline the encryption path and use memoryview to reduce allocations.\n\n```python\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM\n\nclass Solver:\n    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs):\n        # Your complete optimized implementation here\n        pass\n```\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- Always output the COMPLETE Solver class code, not partial edits\n- Code must be in a ```python block (starting with ```python on its own line)\n- Do NOT use command syntax (edit, eval, ls, etc.)\n- Do NOT output diffs or SEARCH/REPLACE blocks\n- The code must be runnable as-is\n\nOPTIMIZATION TIPS:\n- You have 8 CPU cores available for parallelization\n- Avoid if __name__ == \"main\" blocks (only solve() will be executed)\n- Compilation time of __init__() doesn't count towards runtime\n- After evaluation, you'll receive performance metrics vs baseline\n- Focus on speed while maintaining correctness\n\nGOALS:\nYour PRIMARY objective is to MAXIMIZE SPEEDUP (make your solver faster than baseline).\n- You succeed when speedup > 1.0x (faster than baseline)\n- You fail if speedup < 1.0x (slower than baseline) OR if any test fails\n- Higher speedup = better performance = higher score\n\nAfter each evaluation, focus on the speedup metric to guide your optimizations.\n\nBelow you find the description of the task you will have to solve.
